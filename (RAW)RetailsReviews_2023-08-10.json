It is perfect. It is lightweight and easy to use. It does not take up a lot of space and the attachments are easy stored inside the tower. Battery lasts about 30 minutes when running nonstop. There is also an extra battery if you need to vacuum longer. I love that I can take this vacuum anywhere without having to worry about tripping on a cord. The only problem I have found is that it does clog pretty easily but it is easy to unclog. The vacuum slides apart with a push of a button and you can remove the clogs. The suction power is really good and it also has different speeds of suction depending on what your cleaning. I highly recommend this vacuum especially for someone who isn\u2019t able to lift much weight. I use it in my car, Rv and home with no problems. It also empties itself inside a bag that is stored in the tower so your not always having to empty it after each use."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"Jul 7, 2023","REVIEWER_NAME":"Cooll101","TITLE":"Awesome cordless vacuum","CONTENT":"I had it for two weeks and it is the best .

I\u2019d been so excited for it to arrive, and patiently waited for my husband to put it together. (Took him about 20 minutes.)  \r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n- it\u2019s quiet. SO quiet, that I thought it wasn\u2019t working, u til I noticed the internal dust cup filling up. \r\n- it\u2019s lightweight. I have owned 2 other cordless vacuums and this one is the lightest by far. \r\n- since it vacuums itself, I have yet to have a clog - something that I was having frequently with other brands. \r\n- all of its accessories are stored right in the unit, making them easy to store and find when I need them. Again, other vacuum parts have been difficult to manage. \r\n- comes with 2 batteries. My house is small, so I\u2019ve never run out of battery while using it. But having a spare on hand is very nice. \r\n\r\nRoom for improvement:\r\n- the dust cup is tiny. It fills up way faster than the battery runs out. \r\n- while it\u2019s nice the height is adjustable, it only fits on the base at the smallest size. So it\u2019s a bit tedious taking it on and off the base. \r\n- the internal dust storage bin is very small, and I really wish the bags were reusable. Seems very wasteful. \r\n- while it\u2019s fancy that the vacuum cleans itself, it takes a silly amount of time to return to the base, lower the height, hook it on the base, and wait for it to empty. It\u2019s much easier to walk to the nearest trash can, empty it, and continue cleaning. \r\n\r\nThis is a good vacuum. It works well. I can feel the intensity change as I move from carpet to hardwood and back again. I just don\u2019t love it, some of the features seem a bit unnecessary. If you really want to have the fanciest vacuum available, this one absolutely suits you. If not, you may find it better to find something a bit less fancy."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":3,"POST_DATE":"Jun 25, 2023","REVIEWER_NAME":"Fayt413","TITLE":"It works great, when its not plugged up","CONTENT":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It's easy to charge and add attachments.

Overall this is the best cordless vacuum that I have ever owned and here are the reasons why.\r\n\r\n1. The vacuum is much lighter compared to other cordless vacuums that I have owned. My previous vacuum seemed like a workout when I vacuumed the whole house. Whereas this one is a breeze.\r\n2. Battery life. This vacuum does a great job keeping my 2200 square foot home clean and hasn't run out of power yet and if it does I am not worried because there is a spare always charging in the vacuum base.\r\n3. The suction. Boy does this vacuum suck but in a good way. On the highest setting it is pulling up the dirt stuck UNDER my carpet which I have never had a vacuum do.\r\n4. The base. I like that this vacuum has a base where you plug it into. Not only does it make the kids put it up instead of leaving it wherever like they did with the old vacuum but it also provides a convenient storage location for all of the vacuum accessories.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the one thing that I do not like about this vacuum.\r\n1.

LG really hit it out the park with this vacuum! It does is all! Vacuums, mops, empties debris on it own! Set up was relatively easy, maybe 15-20 minutes, and it is only because everything comes so well packed. The mop features 2 dual spinning microfiber pads, which do all the hard work for you. My other mop is officially retired! I have never seen my kitchen floors so clean! The vacuum has a 5 step HEPA filtration system,  so you know you are getting a clean carpet with less allergens left behind. It comes with 2 batteries, it is recommended to switch them out after every use to extend the life of the batteries. Which makes sense and is very fast and simple to do. They say it goes about 2hr before needing a charge or needing to switch batteries.  But honestly, it only takes 20- 30 minutes to completely clean my floors. The housing tower is great! It's stylish but low-key so it does not stand out. It houses just about everything, it is great having everything in one spot! It empties the broom stick in seconds and is relatively a quite process. Over all it went way beyond my expectations!

It's very light and functional that it did each step with only one hand and didn't have to fumble around with the cord.

It actually had quite a bit of power when you use the turbo button. I like that it has additional attachments. It works great on our carpet and on our tile. The only downside I\u2019ve noticed is that having pets seems to make it clog from the fur sometimes. And another thing that I\u2019m not really happy about is the bags. While it did come with three of them, they are very small. And they are also not reusable, I can\u2019t empty them and then reuse them. I have a large family with animals, this just isn\u2019t economical for us to have to buy new bags that hold so little debris.

It currently sits in my dining room, where it has plenty of space to stand out. I must say, the tower is quite sturdy and complements any decor beautifully. It not only serves as a storage area for the spare battery but also provides a special spot for all the additional attachments. Once you're done vacuuming, simply press the button on the tower, and it will effortlessly empty the debris from the vacuum, conveniently storing the vacuum itself.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the vacuum itself. It's a typical stick vacuum, but what's impressive is how quiet it is. It's by far the quietest vacuum I've ever used, and its lightweight design makes it ideal for quick and easy clean-ups. It's especially efficient at picking up dust, small crumbs, and pet hair. The lightweight feature also makes it a breeze to clean furniture and tackle stairs in the house. In terms of suction power, it performs admirably in regular mode. If you need some extra oomph, there's a turbo mode available that provides a significant boost in suction power, although it does come with increased noise and power consumption. The turbo mode drains a fully charged battery in about 10 minutes, so it's better suited for shorter cleaning sessions. Thankfully, the battery lasts much longer when using the regular mode. As a mother of young kids, I must admit that I was slightly disappointed with its ability to handle larger crumbs with ease. Additionally, I found it a bit challenging to push on my rugs compared to hard surface floors.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a great lightweight stick vacuum that works wonders for quick cleaning on hard surface floors and furniture. The tower is a practical addition, ensuring that the vacuum is always conveniently ready for use. Plus, having an extra battery is a real lifesaver, providing ample power to meet all your vacuuming needs. Personally, I particularly appreciate the tower's self-emptying function, the option to switch batteries, and the storage space for all the additional accessories."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"May 26, 2023","REVIEWER_NAME":"dengreat","TITLE":"Looks Great, Easy to Use, Luxurious","CONTENT":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is the height of luxury for stick vacuum cleaners!\r\nWhat I like\r\n- Starts charging when you hang it up\r\n- Has backup battery charged and ready to go at all times\r\n- The telescoping extension for the upright head\r\n- built-in storage for accessories\r\n- auto-empties dust bin when you hang it up!\r\n- extremely easy to use\r\n- press a button to turn it on and off instead of holding a trigger\r\n- very stable base instead of cheap wall-mounted plastic\r\n- looks very pleasing to the eye.

I am quite the vacuum snob so I am not easily impressed lol. I have hardwood, tile floors, carpet and shag area rugs in my house and this vacuum works beautifully on all of them. Some of the things that stand out the most to me are how it effectively cleans and fluffs the shag area rugs without getting bogged down like my other stick vac. I think the diameter of the agitator helps since it is so large and the shag cannot wrap around it at all. The suction on the bare tile and hardwood it fantastic and I am super impressed but the suction and cleaning ability against baseboards. The docking station and self cleaning feature is fantastic. I love that you store all of the attachments in the base and that you have a backup battery ready to go! The battery life is much better than my other stick vacs I\u2019ve had.

This one takes the cake as my new favorite. First impression is that it LOOKS great, I hardly want to move it to a closet or the laundry room because it is so sleek looking. The tower holds all accessories, which is awesome because if they don\u2019t have a place they usually get lost in my house, only to be found 3 years later. Also, the auto empty feature of the tower is just awesome. The other stick vacs that I have used were always a pain to empty, and I would wind up getting dirt and dust all over the garbage can, or the floor that I just cleaned. Now everything is contained. Right from the vacuum to a large bag in the tower! This LG vacuum is also a breeze to use, it feels balanced in my hand. The telescoping tube is a great feature, and allows me to clean without bending over (I\u2019m 6 foot tall). As for power, there is no shortage. Just on the normal mode it does a great job, but when you turn on turbo there is a noticeable difference in power. This difference in power makes it slightly louder, but still not as loud as other vacuums we own. The kompressor feature is also a great addition. As you\u2019re vacuuming you can push all the dust and pet hair collected down, leaving more room before emptying. Which is externally helpful if you live in a house that doubles as a zoo like us (2 dogs, a cat, a snake, a lizard, and of course three kids under 13). The tower also holds an additional battery, which stays charged for longer cleaning. All you have to do is open the top, and swap out the awaiting battery, and off you go! Great idea! The app is a nice feature to have, it logs the cleaning time and amount used. It also can notify you on when filters need to be cleaned and changed. The app also tells you the battery life remaining, and when the unit has finished charging.

I was also excited that it might get used on the carpets in my vehicle.  What I was NOT expecting was:\r\n- A truly long battery life\r\n- A lightweight vacuum that I could easily carry all around my home\r\n- An enjoyable vacuuming experience\r\nOur home is 2500 square feet.  I used this first on my carpeted stairs, next I tackled the first floor, then I redid the stairs (with an attachment this time), and then last I did the entire second floor.  I depleted the first battery after about 35 minutes of use (much of that use was on Power Mode) and then I only used the second battery for a couple of minutes (showed 99% full battery when I finished) I used the Normal mode on my hard floors and the Power mode on my carpeted areas.\r\n\r\nI found it to be very easy and intuitive to set up and use the base station. I love that the included attachments are neatly stored (cannot say the same for my corded vacuum's attachments which can rarely even be found let alone used)  It's a real treat to have this in my home and I actually enjoy using it.  It's not giving me shoulder pain or a weird callus on my hand from using it for so long (I'm not the only one right?).... it's just light, easy, and powerful.

We bought  Dyson Ball for 25.00 about 9 years ago and it's just recently died, and we replaced it with another Dyson, and then got the Dyson stick vacuum. I was reluctant to try out the LG, but the cordless Dyson dies too quickly for my comfort and I'd heard great things about the LG, so decided to take the chance. I'm so glad I did! So, I recently received the CordZeroTM All in One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty, and it has absolutely transformed my cleaning routine. This vacuum outperforms all of my expectations in terms of performance and design.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, let me express how amazed I am with how wonderfully this vacuum cleans. It effortlessly picks up dirt, dust, and debris, leaving my floors spotless and my carpets looking new. It's extremely effective and can even trap small particles, ensuring a thorough cleaning every time. It also offers several cleaning modes, allowing me to vary the suction intensity based on what I'm cleaning.\r\nThe automatic emptying feature of the CordZeroTM is one of its distinguishing features. It's simply incredible! No more filthy trash cans for me. This vacuum empties the dirt into a base station on its own, making it extremely easy and sanitary. I don't have to worry about touching the dust or making a mess. It's a clever touch that distinguishes this vacuum from the competition.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of the CordZeroTM is its ease of portability. It's lightweight, cordless, and glides from room to room with ease. I can easily reach difficult areas and maneuver around objects. When I need to clean above the floor, it converts into a handheld device, making it quite adaptable.\r\n\r\nThe CordZeroTM's battery life is also outstanding.

I need encouragement to keep up with dusting, and so I appreciate the convenience ofa cordless vac but I hate dealing with emptying any Bagless vac which are the most popular these days. The feature of having bagged and filtered emptying into the recharging station is a great solution. By the way, the station also works for emptying other Cord Zero models, even the non-compressor units seem to work fine. So we keep our previous model upstairs and use the downstairs Auto Empty station for it as well.\r\n\r\nThe other big point, which LG doesn't seem to promote very much, is that these vacuums are notably quieter than most competitors. We previously had one of the competing models from the well known deluxe brand, and I hated it because it was so loud and very shrill sounding. The LG is deceptively powerful considering how much quieter it runs. Of course you can boost the speed, but even on Turbo the LG is not as hurtful to the ears. Note also that dogs and cats are more sensitive to loud high pitched noises than we are, they don't run away from this vacuum like they did with the other one. This quietness benefit is hard to prove from just reading the websites. Check out the Project Farm video comparison on YouTube where he reports the measured sound level of all tested units.

The vacuum came with so many assorted attachments including one for pet hair and a mopping attachment. It also came with an extra battery which I love!  The run time on one battery is a little over an hour if I keep it in auto mode and don't switch to Turbo. I love having that extra battery on hand and charged up the Tower when I need it. One unique feature about the CordZero is that it's handy base recharges it, stores the extra parts, battery and attachments as well as has an Auto Empty feature for cleaning out the debris from the vacuum dust bin! I love that is takes one more clean up step out of my normal routine! The tower is makes keeping all of the extra things that can be used with the vacuum so nice and tidy and in one spot for easy access. The vacuum is lightweight and the main attachment is easy to get around and under furniture. I like that the main attachment head is a bit smaller than some of the others I've seen as it can really get into tight spaces and under chairs. I love that when I turn it on, I don't have to keep holding down on a button to keep the suction going as I've had to do on vacuums I've had in the past. It does seamlessly from my hardwood to my tile to my carpet rugs and has a great Turbo mode that can be turned on for those places I worry have extra hard to reach dirt. The CordZero even has ap app that you can connect to that will show you run times. extra info on the troubleshooting and battery life. I think one of the super exciting things about the CordZero is that it has a mop attachment. Although this feature didn't live up to my expectations, I'll thrilled of the idea of a vacuum\/mop combo!  The mop attachment has a place to put in water and it has little round pads that velcro on to the vacuum and spin around once you start it up. You can control the amount of water that comes out (it has a low to high setting) but the problem  I had was that I didn't think it really \"mopped\" my floor. There was moisture but it can't be used with soap or cleaner of any kind and I just don't feel like my floor are properly \"mopped \" with just a slight layer of water. I used the microfiber mop heads for about 15 minutes on my tile while I was trying out the mopping feature and once done, the mop heads were already frazzled and looked to be coming undone. I love the IDEA of the mop combo, but in my ideal world, it would have been able to be used with a cleaner to really get it good and clean and I would have more function in the amount of water that comes out ( I couldn't tell much difference in the low or high adjustments on the mop attachment). Also, the suction is turned off when you use the mop attachment and I would love to see a function added to be able to use the mop with water and cleaner and then have it sucked back up or go back over the water with a drying function. Again, I love the idea, but feel like the mop attachment could have some improvement to make it a 5 star product. I do like that the mop attachment has a little blue light that shines to help show you where the water is on the floor. Overall, I am thrilled with the uniqueness and creativity that this LG CordZero Vacuum brings to my home. The tower with it's multitude of functions is a real game changer in my book!"},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"Sep 7, 2022","REVIEWER_NAME":"Anonymous","TITLE":"All the bells and whistles!","CONTENT":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum has all the bells and whistles!

The feature that this has are amazing. Let me start with the sucking power of this vacuum. When this is on normal it is strong and great for loose crumbs, pet hair , dirt, etc. click it up to turbo and it get down deep in the carpet for dirt a normal vacuum can\u2019t get. Next let\u2019s go to the battery life. 2 batteries are more than enough to clean an entire house (my house is 2800sq\/ft) and I have battery to spare. Let\u2019s move on to the accessories you get all the tools you need to clean furniture under heat registers to tight spaces behind fridges and under tables. The wet mop head is efficient in cleaning your hard floors to a great shine and clean the mop head is very easy. Now let\u2019s go to the base, it hides all the tools neatly and it looks modern and no one would know what is in there. The base also sucks out the dirt from the unit into a bag in the base for a hands free cleaning of the dirt out of the unit. Finally the wi fi option is great. Get the app and it tell you how much the vacuum is used, when the batteries are fully charged, the last day you vacuumed, how long you vacuumed, etc. This is a very durable product and is well worth the purchase.

Took a bit to set it all up but once you're done you have an all-in-one tower\/charge station that contains everything you need. All the attachments are stored inside the tower - no clutter at all! The actual vacuum is sleek and lightweight, and the lack of a cord offers so much freedom. It transitions easily between carpet and hardwood floors, and suction is strong even without going into the highest setting. It comes with an extra battery that sits in the tower until you need it, but I haven't had to use it yet! The main perk of this vacuum is the auto-emptying feature; once you've finished vacuuming you just place it back into the charge station and it'll empty itself into a bag installed inside. You can set this to automatic or manual with just a press of a button (and if you're wondering if you can still manually empty it, you can!) There's also an app you can use, and while it's not required to use the vacuum it's very useful to have as it greatly helps with maintenance. I'd recommend it even if you're not a big fan of constant apps like I am. Overall I'd say it's exceeded my expectations. It's plenty strong and the convenience of going cordless is just too good.

They come with mobile apps and lengthy instructions. This vacuum is something new for sure. I am usually not a huge fan of mobile apps for everything but knowing when the vacuum is fully charged or has an issue by checking my phone can be handy sometimes.\r\n\r\n As for the vacuum itself; it works well. I, personally, had no issues with suction. Honestly, I tried all the settings and I can't imagine why anyone would need to use the Turbo function. I can't see how anyone would use that for regular day to day vacuuming. It's REALLY high intensity. The normal, basic setting is just fine for most floors, rugs and carpets. I think the suction is exceptionally good actually. It's amazing how you think something is clean and then see how much dust and hair gets picked up. \r\n\r\nThe pet attachment is handy for small areas that just need a quick clean up. The mop feature is interesting, I probably won't use that one as often. It does work just fine but I just don't like the extra clean-up of the device afterwards. What I really like this for is stairs. It's so much easier to maneuver than a regular vacuum and I can get the corners and angles of the stairs much easier and faster. \r\n\r\nThe automatic empty feature is pretty cool but I find that it only completely emptied the dust container about half the time. Even after compressing it and making sure it's not too full. Sometimes there will still be a bit of debris left that has to be manually emptied. However, that was not a big problem for me. I like the compact base station where you can store and charge the vacuum and all the attachments in one place. It's easy to assemble, charge and to set up.\r\n\r\n My main issue is the sensitivity of the vacuum. It reminds me of old smartphones that had the capability to take very high-resolution photos but the phone itself would practically shut down when you used the feature. A lot of high-tech devices have this issue. They design the appliance to be very advanced but, counterintuitively - also too sensitive, so that it requires constant maintenance just to keep it functional on the most basic level. This is a big issue for me because when I clean; I want to get it done quickly and efficiently. I don't like stopping every few minutes and having to check the vacuum because it's saying it's \"blocked\". Only to have to completely disassemble the entire thing to figure out what tiny bit of fluff is supposedly \"blocking\" it. The usual culprit of the \"blockage\" is a tiny dust bunny or some barely visible piece of fluff that I have to spend 5 minutes and a tweezer to find. More times that I like; I had to give up and just use my regular vacuum cleaner to finish my chores. A big deal breaker for me because I don't like having to walk on eggshells around my appliances because I'm not sure if they'll work or allow me to get my tasks done that day without issue. That is my only but most major con.\r\n\r\nOther than that; this vacuum is very good for basic tasks and day to day cleaning. Great for stairs and small areas. Good suction and helpful features and attachments."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"Aug 31, 2022","REVIEWER_NAME":"E1g1n","TITLE":"LOVE","CONTENT":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have never loved a Vacuum more than this one!

After getting over my initial shock, everything was pretty straightforward to put together and all of the components and attachments\u00a0either store in or hang on the base, so it doesn't take up as much room as I feared.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum itself is deceptively quiet and works great. We have a similar style stick vacuum from another well known brand and it must be 2-3 times louder than this vacuum, but seems to perform the same. We have a dog that'll dash out the doggy door when our old vacuum turns on. With this vacuum, she's still not pleased, but she'll hang out one room over instead of making a beeline for the backyard.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum itself comes with a number of attachments-- a general floor head (with spinning brushes) a narrower pet hair head (with spinning rubber flaps) and a mop (no suction, just rotating pads). It also has the usual brush, crevice tool, etc. One cool thing worth mentioning is that the aluminum tube (between the vacuum and head) is extendable, so this is actually comfortable to use while standing-- you don't have to hunch over.\r\n\r\nFor performance, I find that you can get about 15 minutes out of one battery on the highest speed, but closer to 45 minutes with the lowest speed-- which has more than enough power for hardwood floors, etc. This set also comes with a spare battery (that sits under the lid of the storage tower and is always charged), so you can actually get some cleaning done in between charges.\r\n\r\nThe general flooring head with the bristles works well-- it picks up pretty much everything. The rubber flap head for pet hair is okay. It does good for hair that is fresh on the surface (so couches, car seats, etc)-- but it does not work miracles. If you have a rug with hair that's worked in over the past 2 years and is really embedded in there, not much will get it out, including this head.\r\n\r\nThe mop head is a bit of a disappointment. It has a small reservoir, you can't use hot water, and you can only use plain water (no cleaning solutions). Because of this, it's really limited in its usefulness for me.\r\n\r\nFinally, the base\/storage station is pretty slick. It always keeps the vacuum charged (expected), does a good job at holding all the accessories (good design), but the real feature is the auto emptying of the hand vac. If it's in AUTO mode, as soon as you dock the vacuum, it pops it open, sucks out all the dust and gets it ready to go again. I turned it off of AUTO because it is loud. It's basically as loud as a corded vacuum cleaner when it goes off. Overall, I love it. My only disappointment is that it empties the vacuum into a proprietary LG vacuum bag that they are currently pretty proud of. Hopefully a third party comes out with a more economical choice in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, final verdict? I love it, it's sleek, works well, is quiet, and is well thought out. Don't buy it for the mop feature (more of a gimmick in my eyes) and do be aware of the ongoing costs of the proprietary bags (though you can manually empty the vac into your own trash can, but that kind of negates the best feature of this system-- the auto emptying), but if you can get past those, then I think you'll really like what LG did with this product."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":3,"POST_DATE":"Aug 26, 2022","REVIEWER_NAME":"Gina","TITLE":"Just ok","CONTENT":"Wasn\u2019t thrilled with it for over a grand.

The concept of this vacuum was different, which had me switch over to LG (coming from owning several Dyson vacuums and other Dyson products). After watching many reviews on this vacuum and seeing other people un-boxing videos. I had high hopes for this product. However, the extension pipe arrived with a dent mark. Another worst thing, the main unit was not sucking up any of the dirt! The dirt bin was completely brand new, even after vacuuming the whole basement. The vacuum powers on (for certain attachments) and off, WI-FI worked and connected to device. The power mode did not work at all. The speed of the vacuum was the same, even when trying to switch it to turbo mode. It's like it has only one mode. The lowest mode possible. With the standard attachment, the brush would spin like normal and managed to pick up some debris from the carpet. As soon as I lift the vacuum up, all the debris fell back on the carpet. When I place my hand near the attachment, I can feel the air flow coming out. I tried all the little attachments, couldn't even get the power to turn on. Both batteries were fully charged. \r\n\r\nI reached out to LG support and the representative suggested to ship the main unit back to them for repairs and diagnostic but it'll take 3-5 days to get the shipping box. Plus an additional 7 days for them to do the repairs. The extension pipe is in for replacement. Honestly, for a product that is this pricey. I'm very disappointed. A vacuum that doesn't even vacuum.... I had zero issue with my other vacuums. You buy a product brand new hoping everything will work properly on the first try. \r\n\r\nJust a very bad experience. Will update the review once the unit is repaired. But so far, I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I can't tell you to skip the hassle and go with another brand. At this moment, that's what I'm leaning towards. But I will give it another try once it's fixed."},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":1,"POST_DATE":"Jun 1, 2022","REVIEWER_NAME":"Jennifer","TITLE":"I have to return it since it will never work...","CONTENT":"I have to return it since it will never work nor does anyone want to tell me how to return it"},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"May 14, 2022","REVIEWER_NAME":"Homeowner","TITLE":"Best I've ever owned!","CONTENT":"Easily the best vacuum I've ever purchased.

However the suction is extremely weak and to even get to enough power it has to be at the most powerful turbo mode which only lasts for seven minutes on a four hour battery charge. If this is how weak it is now I hate to think how useless it will become once it starts to lose power. The features on this otherwise are both useful and well made so it having so little power is extremely disappointing. Plus the one tiny wheel is not large enough making using this vacuum extremely hard to move on carpet most vacuums pull away from you and are able to pull in dirt surrounding the outside of the tool but this is unable to do either. Finally the feature that allows you to adjust the height is very nice in thought but due to the fact that it often unlocks during use making it shrink and grow with movement makes it irritating and overall more difficult to use. I was extremely disappointed by all of this as I\u2019m usually a fan of lg products as my fridge, washer, dryer, stove, etc. are all lg products.

It looks so sleek and modern, it holds and hides most of the attachments, it empties itself, and is an absolute workhorse.   This is a great piece of equipment\u2026LG has really outdone itself!\r\n\r\nI will say that removing it from the box can be a little intimidating.  There are a lot of wrapped pieces, and a ton of instructions.  That said, it is intuitively built, so assembling everything is a breeze.  The tower opens to reveal cubbies for the three attachments and the brush for occasional cleanings.  There too is the bag that holds the refuse when the vacuum is emptied.  This is behind a door, so when the tower is opened, everything is put away and tidy.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with a power mop head, though this is very large and will have to be stored separately.  Still, we already had a power mop, so we are actually saving room since we can get rid of it, and only have to store the mop head for the CordZero.\r\n\r\nAnd while we are here, I will say that the mop head works very well, spinning vigorously, and sparing your back, as traditional mopping requires much more elbow grease.  The pads attach using Velcro, and are easily removed and cleaned.  There is a water reservoir and two setting to choose from in terms of wetness.  This head is (as too are all the attachments) easily installed and removed.\r\n\r\nThe stick portion of the device requires depressing a sliding button to choose your desired length, so it works well for those of most heights.  \r\n\r\nThere is a power bottom on the handle, which is great for those with weak hands or aching joints.  Many stick vacuums require you to hold a trigger down, which can be difficult and annoying, but not so with the CordZero.  There are three settings, the lowest being fine for most all the time.  The battery lasts around an hour, though that varies whether we are using it on our wood floors or carpets.  The top setting eats the battery quickly, so we rarely use it.  Still, it comes with two batteries, one of which charges in a cubby at the top of the tower while not in use, and you are meant to trade them with each run (as they will, according to the instructions, lose their ability to hold a charge over time).  We haven\u2019t experienced reduced battery yet, so I can\u2019t comment on that.  The batteries seat nicely in both the vacuum and tower.\r\n\r\nThis thing really is a marvel to look at, especially considering it\u2019s a vacuum.  The tower is spare and modern, casting minimalistic lines, and not drawing undue attention, but fitting in well.  This is great for us, as we don\u2019t have a closet with an outlet inside, so the CordZero has to stay out in a room.  I imagine this is true for many people, so that fact that it looks so clean is a huge plus\u2026it doesn\u2019t clutter up your space, but instead blends into it.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum does feel a bit heavier that precious stick vacuums we\u2019ve owned, but none are as feature robust, and most are corded so you can\u2019t free range your home with them.  It is quite loud when you place it in the tower and it empties itself, but it only lasts a few seconds, so it doesn\u2019t cause much distraction.  Too, this certainly has more power than I expected, so kudos to LG for that.\r\n\r\nWe really are over the moon with the CordZero\u2026it can do everything, so were able to declutter by removing  an old corded stick vacuum, and a corded power mop.  And we can do it in high style.  \r\n\r\nFrom the aesthetics to the functionality, the LG CordZero is top notch, and I really couldn\u2019t recommend it highly enough!"},{"RETAILER":"THE HOME DEPOT","PRODUCT":"LG CordZero","RATING":5,"POST_DATE":"Nov 26, 2021","REVIEWER_NAME":"LalaT","TITLE":"Game changer!","CONTENT":"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I LOVE this product.

Even before I used the cordless stick vacuum to clean my home, I instantly felt that my house improved a few notches by having this fancy and extra sleek all-in-one tower displayed proudly in my laundry room.  Not only does it it look beautiful, but it holds a myriad of tools and accessories that can be used to clean just about everything in your home. The suction of the vacuum is fantastic and the battery charge lasts for a very long time. An extra battery is included, but I haven't found it necessary since the charge hold is more than sufficient. The Vacuum itself is very light and it's easy to maneuver. \r\n\r\nAll of the six tools included in the tower have come in handy, but I especially love the  mop nozzle option.  It is super easy to use and only requires water while getting your tile and hardwoods spotless!  \r\nAnother favorite feature of the LG CordZero is that the vacuum is cordless so you don't have to worry about getting tangled up in cords. Not having to constantly rearrange cords makes along with not having to find outlets to replug as you move through your home makes cleaning a lot less daunting. Lastly, the vacuum automatically clears the dust and dirt into a collection bag within the tower so you can don't have to \"clean up after you clean up\"!
