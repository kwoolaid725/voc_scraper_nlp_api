      <td>I like it . I’ll start by saying, I’d never have bought myself this vacuum as it is pretty cost prohibitive . My mother bought it for me as a gift and I’ve been pleasantly surprised . It has better suction than I expected it would . And since it is lightweight, I grab it almost everyday instead of a broom for my tile floors and instead of my bulky vacuum for carpets .By far, the most valuable feature is the fact that u don’t have to open that canister to empty it out .

I really didn't expect to get much up, because I vacuumed last week (only 2 clean freaks in the house) .  Much to my surprise, it pulled up a lot of stuff!  It was easy to unpack .  The tower houses all the tools .  The cleaning function worked great .  It emptied all the dirt .  I read all the instructions, which I think is important for running it at it's best .  I'll be ordering a new one .  My only negatives are that the vacuum heads seem cheaply made for the money .  The plastic seems like it will break easily .  The battery does run down quickly on power modes, and it did start feeling heavy by the time I was done vacuuming 3600 Sq Ft .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update . We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot . Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning . Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking . Went to the new Shark, nice but loud . Worked well, a bit heavy . Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out . After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional . Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too . Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it . It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time . It is very lightweight, surprisingly so . The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus . No switch to push between carpet and flooring . The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway . That actually straightens out the fringe . Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight . So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough . Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag . Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories . Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops . Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand . Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are . Yep, really big complaints there . We believe this was well worth the cost .Little update concerning fringe . Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides . Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming . Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened . The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing . Gee, impressed even more .</td>

It either cannot remove it from the canister, or worse, it removes it from the canister but leaves it in the opening to the collection bag so it all falls on the floor when you remove the vacuum from the stand . We have even found the canister lid left open after the clean cycle because all the fur didn't get out - and the remaining contents all fell on the floor .We like the vacuum enough to keep experimenting with it - it's just somewhat disappointing that it handles pet fur so poorly . Rated it three stars because it is a good device, minus pet fur .</td>
