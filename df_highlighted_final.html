      <td>The LG vacuum is great, lightweight and cleans not only hard floor and carpet, but also itself. The battery lasts about 1.5 hours, which should be enough to clean the It comes with a second battery that can be charged while the primary battery is being used. The charging dock however has a place to store and charge both batteries at the same time if needed.  All accessories have storage space in the base, so you don't have to find a place for them. Has awesome wifi features to detect cleaning efficiency.\n\nThe mop attachment is not better than a steam mop but it does the job. The motor is quiet and mobility is smooth and effortless when pushing along the floor. I love the self cleaning feature, saves me time from cleaning out the vacuum myself. It does get loud during this process but it only lasts around 20 seconds. I had to clean out the canister that the waste goes in every 4 full uses, which isn't that often. Assembly is easy, just came in 5 pieces.\n\nOverall, the vacuum is a well needed product and  conveniently packaged in a way to prevent major maintenance.</td>

      <td>We’ve had this vacuum a few weeks and are completely satisfied. It has strong suction and the back up battery helps us get our full house completed. Knowing that we have a limited time helps us clean faster too. I was worried that there would be an issue with it picking up cereal because of previous reviews, but it looks like that has been updated. We are always vacuuming up Cheerios with no problem. The sleek design and cool feature have interested our oldest in helping out around the house vacuuming every chance they get. I also love the self emptying feature. I took a star off because it can only be stored on a hard surface which is limiting. Otherwise this was a great investment. I would for sure recommend.</td>

The difference attachments make this vacuum one of the most versatile, if not THE most versatile (and lightweight!) vacuums money can buy currently! The LG mobile app this device pairs with could use some refining. The self emptying feature is me and my 2 year old sons favorite feature by far. The only thing I wish was different about this product is that it came with more dust bins for the self emptying feature within the housing for the vacuum. Overall I am happy with this purchase!

      <td>Update? The mop has still never worked even after a new mop head was sent.Now the vacuum is hopelessly clogged. For this much $ I should not have to tear it apart to unclog every time I use it. vacuum completely My mop hasn’t worked not once. When I called again I was told my request would be submitted for approval to send another nozzle. I’ve had this just a few days over one month. I haven’t heard back yet to be informed if my request for a mop head that works to be sent.When i first receive the unit it would turn in then off and on and off without me actually powering up and off.Great idea!  Don’t be an early adopter of this unit. I’m back to my shark and manual mopping. Expensive , VERY expensive when it doesn’t work.AND NOW…. The auto empty function sprays dust EVERYWHERE…. YES I replace the bags, pome and prod and unclog.This vacuum doesn’t pick up garbage BUT IS EXPENSIVE GARBAGE.had to start using my animal vacuum again. It lasted a long time (animal) but gave up. STILL better than cordzeroDONT DO IT!!!.  Run away and don’t look back!</td>

It has two batteries to ensure that I can finish the job.  The charging tower serves as the charging base as well as storing all the extra attachments. You can quickly switch the attachments. It has a crevasse tool to reach between couch cushions, a dusting brush, a pet tool to easily pick up pet hair from my furniture, there's even a mop attachment to do hard surfaces.  The ThinQ app will help with maintenance of the vacuum. It has a gratis that will automatically empty the debris that you've vacuumed after each time you use the vacuum. With the kompressor, you can compact debris you've picked up giving additional space to finish vacuuming.  The wand is adjustable in length. There are three modes of vacuum power.</td>

      <td>I wanted to love it and I rarely return but…sigh</td>
      <td>I really wanted to love this machine.  My vacuum died and company was coming.  I love LG products so when the salesman suggested it we went for it, without reading the reviews. Got it home, put it together and after vacuuming about 20 sq feet of an oriental rug it started to whir three times and died…plugged.   Put it on the stand to clear and that didn’t work.  You have to pull out the metal part in the middle of the canister and maneuver your hand to try and clear the too small pipe that feeds the canister.  This machine constantly clogs on anything from pet fur to tiny cellophane candy wrappers.  If you are lucky you can finish vacuuming an 8 x 10 rug if you manually empty it three times.   I’m allergic to dust so a self cleaning vacuum would have been sooo nice but I was constantly manually emptying it.  The other features are great.  It’s light and easy to maneuver.  Suction was good.  It’s quiet and was the first vacuum that didn’t scare my dog. The accessories were plentiful.  It had style and was ok in my dining room. Darn you LG.  I honestly tried. In fact I’m lucky I’m a total tach member and get more than 15 days to return. I bought another that is for pets and it’s doing a great job.  In fact the first time I used it I knew immediately that the LG suction was inferior based on what it was picking up on just the Oriental rug. I’m really not sure how this product got into production.  Great idea, poorly executed.</td>

      <td>Very High Quality Unit</td>
      <td>I have been using this vacuum for 6 months now and I am very impressed. All the materials are high quality. It does a good job of emptying the dirt out when you stow it. Super easy to use, I would highly recommend this to anyone. The mop attachment actually works good on my hard wood floors. I was worried that it wouldn't perform well since there wasn't any suction and it was just a mop. But it actually picks up a lot of dirt and does a good job scrubbing. 10/10 would recommend. \r\n\r\nI have a 2000 square foot house that is 50/50 carpet and hardwood and I never go through a single battery. So the second battery isn't really needed. The first battery seems to last for almost an hour. And with how dusty Texas is I usually fill up the container in 20-30 minutes and hang up the vacuum. So I have never had to swap out the battery.</td>

      <td>Best vacuum ever.</td>
      <td>I love it! It takes a minute to understand all the lights and features but you get the hang of it. The best part is no cord to drag around, and the stand charges and empties the canister while hanging. It does get clogged with large items but its easy to disassemble and remove clog. It has a compression feature that allows for more space to continue vacuuming. The bag in the charging stand looks small, but it holds a lot. Because its emptied into a bag there is no dust every where. It comes with an extra battery but I haven't had to use it. I also use this on my hardwood floor.  The filters are washable in the sink.</td>

      <td>Wow, wow, wow…this LG CordZero Vacuum is incredible.  It looks so sleek and modern, it holds and hides most of the attachments, it empties itself, and is an absolute workhorse.   This is a great piece of equipment…LG has really outdone itself!\r\n\r\nI will say that removing it from the box can be a little intimidating.  There are a lot of wrapped pieces, and a ton of instructions.  That said, it is intuitively built, so assembling everything is a breeze.  The tower opens to reveal cubbies for the three attachments and the brush for occasional cleanings.  There too is the bag that holds the refuse when the vacuum is emptied.  This is behind a door, so when the tower is opened, everything is put away and tidy.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with a power mop head, though this is very large and will have to be stored separately.  Still, we already had a power mop, so we are actually saving room since we can get rid of it, and only have to store the mop head for the CordZero.\r\n\r\nAnd while we are here, I will say that the mop head works very well, spinning vigorously, and sparing your back, as traditional mopping requires much more elbow grease.  The pads attach using Velcro, and are easily removed and cleaned.  There is a water reservoir and two setting to choose from in terms of wetness.  This head is (as too are all the attachments) easily installed and removed.\r\n\r\nThe stick portion of the device requires depressing a sliding button to choose your desired length, so it works well for those of most heights.  \r\n\r\nThere is a power bottom on the handle, which is great for those with weak hands or aching joints.  Many stick vacuums require you to hold a trigger down, which can be difficult and annoying, but not so with the CordZero.  There are three settings, the lowest being fine for most all the time.  The battery lasts around an hour, though that varies whether we are using it on our wood floors or carpets.  The top setting eats the battery quickly, so we rarely use it.  Still, it comes with two batteries, one of which charges in a cubby at the top of the tower while not in use, and you are meant to trade them with each run (as they will, according to the instructions, lose their ability to hold a charge over time).  We haven’t experienced reduced battery yet, so I can’t comment on that.  The batteries seat nicely in both the vacuum and tower.\r\n\r\nThis thing really is a marvel to look at, especially considering it’s a vacuum.  The tower is spare and modern, casting minimalistic lines, and not drawing undue attention, but fitting in well.  This is great for us, as we don’t have a closet with an outlet inside, so the CordZero has to stay out in a room.  I imagine this is true for many people, so that fact that it looks so clean is a huge plus…it doesn’t clutter up your space, but instead blends into it.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum does feel a bit heavier that precious stick vacuums we’ve owned, but none are as feature robust, and most are corded so you can’t free range your home with them.  It is quite loud when you place it in the tower and it empties itself, but it only lasts a few seconds, so it doesn’t cause much distraction.  Too, this certainly has more power than I expected, so kudos to LG for that.\r\n\r\nWe really are over the moon with the CordZero…it can do everything, so were able to declutter by removing  an old corded stick vacuum, and a corded power mop.  And we can do it in high style.  \r\n\r\nFrom the aesthetics to the functionality, the LG CordZero is top notch, and I really couldn’t recommend it highly enough!</td>

      <td>I have read many of the comments from previous reviewers, and agree with all those who said this is a great stick vacuum. I too have a Dyson Animal stick so I was keen to compare. Especially with short dog hair. I can say it works fantastic for that and I am super pleased. I like that I don't have to hold a button down while vacuuming. I also like that the vacuum has a built in extender, so once you take it out of the charging station you can manually elongate the stick because it's already inside (then with the push of a button make it shorter again to store and charge). I like that you don't have to use the auto-empty feature simply by turning that auto feature to OFF in the charging station (because those bags are not eco-friendly and are made with plastic so they need to be thrown in the trash when they are full - BTW in this day and age why not make these bags compostable at least?). Love the replacement battery so you never run out of vacuum time. I wish it had a light so you can see small objects in darker rooms before rolling over them. Mine did not come with the mopping feature so not sure how that feature works, but overall a great stick vacuum system. Pricey, but works great.</td>

      <td>Versatile. Good suction. Extra cleaning steps.</td>
      <td>Pro:\n-Lightweight and versatile\n-Storage compartments in the tower\n-Auto empty\n-Battery life\n\nCon:\n-Suction could be better\n-A lot of maintenance \n-Small dirt canister\n-Bag costs\n-Will not pick up larger debris\n-Mop attachment is for light cleaning only\n\nThe Vacuum\nThe vacuum is lightweight and versatile. The multi position extending pipe can be detached, turning it into a handheld vac. It comes with the standard head, the crevice and brush attachment, the mop head, and a cleaning brush. The dust canister is small and the Kompressor is really just a ring that you push down to scrape the dust off the filter and compress it down. \n\nThe Tower\nThe tower is the all in one serving as storage, charger, and auto emptying the vacuum. Aesthetically it’s nice and that doesn’t take up a lot of space. The sides open up for accessory storage, but it can only store the crevice, brush, and pet head attachment. The mop head is hung on a hook on the outside. The top opens up for the secondary battery charging. \n\nThe main feature of the tower is the auto empty function which automatically empties out the dust from the vacuum and into a dust bag on the bottom. The bag is about the size of a bag of coffee, and two is included. An additional pack of three costs $20. It does a good job of fully emptying the dust canister, but it can be loud if only for less than 30 seconds. \n\nCleaning\nThe suction could be better. While it can be powerful at max setting, I find that my other stick vacuum of the same price outperforms this one. On carpet, especially if you have pets, I find the suction on normal and medium somewhat disappointing. It’ll pick up surface level and some hair but it won’t pick up fine dust unless I activate Turbo mode. With Tubo on, it did pick up dust deep in the carpet but I have to go over the area a few times. On normal the battery will last about 30 mins, while Turbo will last about 10 mins.\n\nOn hard wood and tiles, normal was good enough, but the head would not pick up larger debris and just ends up pushing it around. \n\nThe mop attachment is only good light cleaning. It only spins at one speed and can only use water. The amount of water can be adjusted between two settings or off.  It’s good enough for cleaning the bathroom floor or removing shoe prints of tiles. \n\nMaintenance\nThere’s quite a bit of parts that need regular maintenance. The vacuum has two dust filters that need to be cleaned along with the dust canister filter. The tower also has two filters along with having to change out the dust bags. The mop pads need to be hand washed. \n\nIs it worth it?\nIf you really detest the idea of having to empty the canister with your hands and like having the tower to store everything neatly, then yes. The vacuum is light and versatile, giving you an around cleaner. The suction is powerful at max, but there are others that can outperform it. To me, this vacuum adds more steps for the sake of convenience. Rather than emptying out the canister after use, eventually you’ll end up having to open up the tower to replace the bag and have more filters to clean out. Add to that the cost of additional bags.</td>

      <td>First there is not a lot that I can say bad about the stick vacuum. As a vacuum it does a good job. I have had better but no major complaints.  I will say on bare floors with any type of small particles it takes at least a couple of passes to get everything up but it’s not that much worse than other I’ve had (note that this is in the standard mode, you can use the turbo mode and it much better but you suffer in battery.\nPros 1. The extra battery is really nice no one room left and the battery dies. 2. The adjustable stick means that both me and my wife can use it at a comfortable level.  3.  The self evacuating chamber no more spill dust around the trash when emptying. 4. The WiFi connection with the lg apps more cool than any great benefit.\nThe marginal 1. The mop feature - while this is a great feature it performance is just ok, it clean most of the stuff however there is no ability to saturate or scrub. Those would have been nice and problem been a game changer\nNow the con - 1. The size of the base is huge it takes some floor or wall space to store. Much larger than anything else I’ve seen. 2.  I did have a clog at the bend to the floor attached that required some time to break free.  Turn out to be balled up tape with a bunch of stuff attached.  3. And probably most important is the cost at 1K I think there are better option on the market.  I honest would go with one of the cheaper LG models and give up the self emptying canister and mop feature and save 500 to 600, however if you could find one on sale in the 700 range it would be worth it.</td>

      <td>Game Changer!</td>
      <td>This is by far the best vacuum I've ever used. Setup took all of 5-10mins and is an easy one person job. It's so easy to place and take out of charging station. I absolutely love how easy it is to empty out the waste bin. My carpet looks much brighter and I DON'T HAVE TO SWEEP OVER THE SAME AREA more than ONCE!!!! You can change from regular suction to turbo if you need a little bit more power which is a major plus. I've also used on my kitchen flooring which also does an amazing job. I cleaned by steps which can really take a lot of energy, but not with this vacuum. It's very light and functional that it did each step with only one hand and didn't have to fumble around with the cord. Upon setup, I charged for about an hour before my first use and was beyond amazed with the results. If you like a thorough cleaning that doesn't require manual labor.... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

I mean my $50 vacuum does but this over $900 doesn’t.\n\nThe suction is pretty good on carpets but horrible on hardwood floors. I have to use my swiffer instead.\n\nThe lid on the canister has broken off twice and it is IMPOSSIBLE to snap it on yourself so you have to get it repaired.\n\nPurchased 10/22 and in Jan, had to get a replacement lid.\n\nNow In April, the lid has broke AGAIN and the suction tower doesn’t work. I have been trying now for almost two weeks to get this repaired but have been completely ignored by LG support.\n\nWe ended up having to purchase another vacuum since this $900+ garbage one will not. \n\nI am so disgusted and will NEVER buy another LG product.</td>

      <td>I'm in love with a vacuum</td>
      <td>Don't get me wrong, I've always been a fan of technology and enjoy new gadgets. But this thing sucks in the best of ways.  I had been using the same upright vacuum for nearly two decades, so last year I decided it was time to upgrade to a cordless stick vac as my house is small and I've removed all the carpet.  And it is a decent vacuum.  But this thing blows it out of the water.It doesn't have a very large footprint even with the stand.  Still takes less room than my upright did. Great battery life-I can vacuum the whole house and still have plenty of power to spare, and it has a second battery that charges inside the stand so you never have to worry about your vacuum dying mid chore. All the attachments and accessories fit inside the stand as well, so no messy tools hanging around or sticking out.Good suction power. I thought my last stick vac worked well until I used this, then I realized how much dirt I'd been missing.  Easily transitions from hardwood to fluffy rugs with no issue.  Sucks up pine needles out of tightly woven rugs pretty well.  And does very well on the cat hair on their kitty towers.But best of all it empties itself! Even with every other canister style vacuum, there is always some dust that gets loose, or you have to reach up and pull out a fuzz ball. Not anymore! Just place it back on its stand and it does the rest.  Where has this feature been my whole life?So yes, I am 100% in love with a vacuum.</td>

      <td>Nice vacuum with a lot of features</td>
      <td>The LG CordZero is a nice vacuum cleaner with quite a few features. Taking the vacuum out of the box was fairly easy and straight forward. Setting up the unit is fairly easy, but I’d highly suggest reading the manual. There are a lot of things I would have missed if I had not read the manual. The charging base station is pretty much already assembled out of the box. The only labor involved for the base station is placing the gaskets on the bottom of the base plate, and setting the charing base station onto the base plate. The vacuum does a fairly decent job on the different floors I used it on. It did OK on carpet, but I felt it could use a bit more power. This was even after I cracked it up to Power Mode and then to Turbo Mode.  I was able to use it to clean dirt and debris from my hardwood floors. I was a bit nervous using it on my hardwood floors because I only have the Universal Floor Nozzle. I had some debris that got caught underneath the nozzle and slightly scratched an area of my hardwood floors. Perhaps I may look into getting the Slim Hard Floor Nozzle that didn’t come with the unit I have. After I vacuumed the hardwood floors, I then used the mop pads to clean them. The water reservoir isn’t as large as a floor cleaner I own by a different manufacturer. I assumed I would have to fill it up a few times while mopping the floors. I was wrong, and it was enough to clean all of the hardwood floors and tile floors. It did a good job of disbursing the right amount of water. There’s a button to adjust the amount of water you want disbursed while mopping the floors. The mop pads turn in a circular direction, which you cannot adjust the speed at which they spin. The mop nozzle also comes with LED lights on the front that illuminate onto the floor while in use. The charging base station has a nice feature of automatically emptying the debris from the vacuum into a dust bag. Once the bag becomes full overtime, it will have to be disgarded. There’s no way to empty the bags and reuse them because they have a plastic slide rail attached to the top of each bag. I wish the bags were reusable or if they could have used a plastic bin that can be emptied. Over time the price of buying new bags might be costly. I empty most of the debris manually from the vacuum itself into a regular trash can before placing it on the base station. The charging base station comes in auto mode to empty the vacuum when placing in on the base station. This can become quite annoying because every time I place the vacuum on the charging station, it goes into the bag empty mode which is quite loud. I’ve now switched it to manual mode by pressing the Select Mode button on top of the base station. Now when I place the vacuum on the base station to charge, I don’t have to worry about it going into the bag empty mode. You also can’t remove the vacuum from the base station until it goes through the complete cycle. With it being in manual mode now, I don’t have to worry about that anymore. The vacuum also comes with an app that allows you to see the charging status, vacuum history, and other useful information. It was a bit tricky setting it up. I scanned the QR code on that’s located on the vacuum. It automatically took me to the App Store where I was able to download the app. Once I was able to open the app, it then asked me to create an account. Locating my vacuum was easy. I scanned the same QR code again using the app. By using the app to scan the QR code, it now adds the vacuum to your account. The tricky pars was setting up the WiFi. You have connect to the vacuum’s built in WiFi. When it asks for a password you have to type the last 4 characters of the WiFi name of your device twice with no spaces. After that, then the WiFi process is complete. Overall I’m pleased with the vacuum. With the power being slightly lower than what I expected, it has other features that make up for it. It’s still a bit on the pricey side though.</td>

      <td>Great When it Works</td>
      <td>So many appliances now are highly advanced and innovative. They come with mobile apps and lengthy instructions. This vacuum is something new for sure. I am usually not a huge fan of mobile apps for everything but knowing when the vacuum is fully charged or has an issue by checking my phone can be handy sometimes.\r\n\r\n As for the vacuum itself; it works well. I, personally, had no issues with suction. Honestly, I tried all the settings and I can't imagine why anyone would need to use the Turbo function. I can't see how anyone would use that for regular day to day vacuuming. It's REALLY high intensity. The normal, basic setting is just fine for most floors, rugs and carpets. I think the suction is exceptionally good actually. It's amazing how you think something is clean and then see how much dust and hair gets picked up. \r\n\r\nThe pet attachment is handy for small areas that just need a quick clean up. The mop feature is interesting, I probably won't use that one as often. It does work just fine but I just don't like the extra clean-up of the device afterwards. What I really like this for is stairs. It's so much easier to maneuver than a regular vacuum and I can get the corners and angles of the stairs much easier and faster. \r\n\r\nThe automatic empty feature is pretty cool but I find that it only completely emptied the dust container about half the time. Even after compressing it and making sure it's not too full. Sometimes there will still be a bit of debris left that has to be manually emptied. However, that was not a big problem for me. I like the compact base station where you can store and charge the vacuum and all the attachments in one place. It's easy to assemble, charge and to set up.\r\n\r\n My main issue is the sensitivity of the vacuum. It reminds me of old smartphones that had the capability to take very high-resolution photos but the phone itself would practically shut down when you used the feature. A lot of high-tech devices have this issue. They design the appliance to be very advanced but, counterintuitively - also too sensitive, so that it requires constant maintenance just to keep it functional on the most basic level. This is a big issue for me because when I clean; I want to get it done quickly and efficiently. I don't like stopping every few minutes and having to check the vacuum because it's saying it's "blocked". Only to have to completely disassemble the entire thing to figure out what tiny bit of fluff is supposedly "blocking" it. The usual culprit of the "blockage" is a tiny dust bunny or some barely visible piece of fluff that I have to spend 5 minutes and a tweezer to find. More times that I like; I had to give up and just use my regular vacuum cleaner to finish my chores. A big deal breaker for me because I don't like having to walk on eggshells around my appliances because I'm not sure if they'll work or allow me to get my tasks done that day without issue. That is my only but most major con.\r\n\r\nOther than that; this vacuum is very good for basic tasks and day to day cleaning. Great for stairs and small areas. Good suction and helpful features and attachments.</td>

      <td>Amazing Cordless Vacuum</td>
      <td>The technology in this LG cordless vacuum is absolutely amazing.  I have used this vacuum several times in the past week on the same area and it still continues to pick up material every vacuum (simply meaning that it really deep cleans)The vacuum took a few minutes to set up and get working - it’s not simply plug and play, you actually have to follow the directions.  It has multiple attachments that fit into the base unit as well as two separate batteries.  The battery in the vacuum charges first and then the auxiliary or spare battery charges second - which makes perfect sense.There are multiple suction levels (Normal, enhanced, turbo) and they all work very well.  The highest suction level is likely much more than will ever be needed.  The only trouble I really had was hooking the vacuum up to the wifi, I simply couldn’t get it to connect - but why do I need wifi to tell me the status of the vacuum, just not necessary.The base unit has a self empty feature this is amazing - with the press of a button your canister on the vacuum will be emptied into a bag in the base unit keep everything very clean - so one may say big deal, well it really is a big deal.  I hate emptying my canister into the trash and getting all that dust floating everywhere, with this feature all of that is eliminated.Overall this is an amazing vacuum and maybe a bit expensive but worth every penny in my opinion.  I highly recommend this LG vacuum.</td>

      <td>This is a brilliantly designed and beautiful looking unit.  The base is freestanding and holds and charge the stick.  When you put the stick in the base, it starts to suction out the debris in the canister into a bad.  You never have to empty the bin with this unit.  It also stores the extra accessories and extra battery.The stick has great suction and is pretty quiet for being a cordless stick vac.  It rolls around the floor smoothly.  It can pick up dog fur, crumbs and dust.  It won’t pick up anything that is taller than the vac as it has to be able to roll over it to get it.  I have a puppy so I am constantly picking up dog fur everywhere.  I wouldn’t try to pick up anything wet as it is not designed for that.The battery has more than enough run time for me to do a thorough cleaning on my hardwood floors.  It works really well and well thought out.  I love this device.</td>

      <td>The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great vacuum for my entire house.  I had a stick vacuum and a traditional vacuum and I used them in different levels of the house (upstairs/downstairs).  I have all hard floors downstairs and all carpet upstairs.  So I kept the regular vacuum upstairs and the stick vacuum downstairs, which I considered inferior to the stick for carpet.  Don't get me wrong, the stick vacuum that I had worked well, but the regular vacuum was better on carpet.  This LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum solved the need for having two.  The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum works as well on carpet as my traditional vacuum and as well on hard floors as my stick vacuum.  The power is what I need for all of it.\n\nThe thing that I like the most is that this automatically empties when you put it back in the tower.  I never realized how convenient this is.  You just put it back in and it empties and the tower tells you when to empty the bag.  The battery life has been great and there is a second battery and a place in the tower to charge it, so you never have a time that the vacuum is out of commission.  The app is also great.  Connection was easy it has many stats, down to how many times you've used it and how long it ran.  I would recommend the The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum to anyone.</td>

      <td>My vacuum, mops and cleaning accessories are all stored in a messy cabinet and are not very accessible. This cord zero does not only clean our messy 3-child home, it also organizes our cleaning tools to keep the house clean.  \n\nThe station itself looks good. This all-in-one station is not something I can and should keep in the closet—and I actually like it that way. It looks good out in a corner where we can easily pull the vacuum out for cereal grain spills. The design looks neat, the other nozzles and connecting tools can be stored in the station compartments, and the vacuum automatically charges once you park it. The vacuum can automatically empty itself (or you can manually trigger it). It even has a charging / storage for an extra battery which, all you clean freaks with kids out there know how important it is to have a charged EXTRA BATTERY. \n\nPerformance-wise, it is great. I have to use it on TURBO all the time though. The normal mode just does not cut it for me. Maybe I can use that to suck other things? I don’t even know what “other” things are. All I know is, when it comes to vacuuming, it’s either it sucks it or it doesn’t. The turbo does it and for cleaning regularly a 1500 sq ft space of wood floor, I have never encountered having to even use the spare battery.  Another winner for me is the mop tool. You pre-wet the attachment cloths, put water in the bin and I mop away! There is no turbo mode for mopping, but it does the job as well! And I have been using the mop for 40 -45 minutes at a time and I do not run out of battery. This is me going through each sliver of space, slowly on the floor and it mops nicely and consistently. Oh, best of all, it is CORDLESS. I do not have to keep transferring the plug or have to hold a cord up and around me to get mopping done.\n\nThis is just so well-thought out. Even the bags and filter replacement system is easy (which we have not really done after a week of use, because we don’t think about it--- the vacuum empties itself, remember?) It makes the lady of the house happy, and it makes us all happy too. \n\nWe just threw away all our cleaning appliances—corded mops and other vacuum sticks. This is what design is supposed to be. All-in-one—It just made cleaning fun and easy.</td>

      <td>I like stick vacuums, sort of. Some of them are pretty good, but none of them are as good as a regular corded vacuum. The problem with stick vacs is that their mechanisms are basically the same as a robot (Rooma) but on a stick instead of in a robot.I ended up with stick vacuums at three different residences this year (long story). This one should have been my favorite since it's the most high-end, but it wasn't the best vacuum of the three.The suction isn't great with this one, so it doesn't clean around the floorboards very well whether it's on the carpet or hard flooring. This means I had to do a lap around the house with a broom to clean the baseboards, which totally defeats the purpose of a vacuum.Let me back up for a minute to talk about the setup...I'm one of those guys who reads the instructions. I like documentation and I'm paranoid that I'm going to break something expensive, so I read the docs. But I met my match with this product. The amount of documentation was daunting. They could have made a move out of it, but it would have been a three part set of three trilogies like Star Wars. Yes, there was that much documentation. Too bad the docs didn't really provide that much insight.The docs for the mop attachment were pretty good. And that attachment was honestly pretty cool. What it didn't clarify very well though was that the water in the mop attachment was really just to wash away whatever product you applied to the floor. If you wanted the floor to shine, you had to squirt it with something like Mop & Glow first. Fair enough.I feel like I'm rambling a little bit. Sorry about that.One of the other things that bothered me was the cost of the consumables. I would have loved it if the self-emptying feature emptied the vac into something reusable, but it emptied into a special bag and the replacement bags were really hard to find. Last I checked, the bags weren't available on Amazon but I found them at a local vacuum shop for something like $30 for a 2-pack. Not interested. I quit looking after that and just emptied the vac into the trash by hand. It was easier and cheaper that way.The one thing they really got right though was the attachment storage. You just opened the doors on the tall base and there was a home for each of the attachments. Nice.So all in all, this vacuum looks pretty cool and it's easy enough to operate. My complaints are: an insane amount of disorganized documentation, expensive consumables, and middle of the road suction. And my praises are: a pretty decent wet mop solution, an attractive base (if you're into droids), and superior storage for the attachments.None of this adds up to nearly a thousand bucks worth of value to me.</td>

      <td>Very nice cordless vacuum</td>
      <td>This is a really nice cordless vacuum model. It is really sleek looking and my wife doesn’t mind having it on display, unlike our other vacuum that has been relegated to the closet. It was easy to put together and set up. It actually had quite a bit of power when you use the turbo button. I like that it has additional attachments. It works great on our carpet and on our tile. The only downside I’ve noticed is that having pets seems to make it clog from the fur sometimes. And another thing that I’m not really happy about is the bags. While it did come with three of them, they are very small. And they are also not reusable, I can’t empty them and then reuse them. I have a large family with animals, this just isn’t economical for us to have to buy new bags that hold so little debris. I’ve had it for a short time, and I’m already on my last bag that was included. I do appreciate the design and overall functionality of this device though. I love that it self empties and has such a long charge life. I just can’t see having to keep purchasing the bags constantly.</td>

The auto empty feature is also awesome  but you really need additional suction to get anything done which uses up the battery quicker. Luckily it has 3 different suction options.

      <td>If you are trying to pick up dust from your floors, I assume it would work okay, but any little bit of dog hair, forget about it. After I used it the very first time, I had to literally pick the dog hair out of it by hand. It gets stuck in the small compartment above the slide down lever. My house is not full of dog hair, it is very clean and I purchased this to clean the tile floors. It didn’t last through one cleaning. It clogged and it took me an hour to pick the hair out of the mechanism. Really bad design. They need to remove the slide down lever and ring so it doesn’t back up and clog. It sat in the box for a month before I used it so now I’m stuck with it. So frustrating. If you have a dog, don’t buy it.</td>

      <td>Using this thing is a breeze. The all-in-one stand is a new bare minimum feature I would expect from stick vacuums moving forward. It really solves so many problems for stick-vacs (ie. clean & easy emptying, charging, tool storage, extra battery!!). Plus its looks are premium and second to none. Much more mature aesthetic than Dyson imo. Having owned a Dyson v7, this one is miles ahead in virtually every way.\nHowever, this is not a real vacuum. It can't compete for the price point against a high quality canister like the Miele C3. Seriously, this is 75% of real vacuum at the very best. Personally, I would choose a plug-in all day over this. But, for those who know they want a battery-vac, or those who already have a working plug in which they want to add to, this is as good as it gets.\nFive Stars.</td>

      <td>I got this a week ago and it’s wonderful. I don’t know why I waited so long to try a LG vacuum. It’s quiet and light. The best part is that it self empties. No more emptying the collection container over a dirty trash can. My hands can stay clean while this empties on its own in a minute.  The tower came pre assembled. The only thing you can to put together is the vaccum and it was super easy to figure out. It also comes with extra nozzle in the box. I am so happy with this vaccum. Will be recommending it to everyone!</td>

Lightweight and maneuverable I vacuumed my stairs and put it on the charging station.  Then it was stuck on the station.  Spent an hour trying to get it unhooked.  I saw that the back door on the barrel opens up to empty the dust and the internal metal filter had been sucked right out and was in the base preventing the back door from closing on the vacuum barrel.  Within 5 hours of delivery it was boxed up, stuck on the base for return.  Sad …… I really did love it.</td>

      <td>We take lots of time to think about all of our purchases, and usually do tend toward purchasing more expensive options of things due to wanting good quality instead of the throw away garbage our society has steered so heavily towards, though even highly priced items can sometimes be hunks of junk.\r\n\r\nThat was luckily not the case for this vacuum! While unpacking the vacuum it quickly became clear that this was really quality, there are even some metal parts instead of plastic which was so refreshing to see!\r\n\r\nThe vacuum works very well, it’s easy and fun to use, has some great attachments that come with it, and is so nice to just turn the power on instead of having to hold down a trigger constantly to use like so many stick vacuums have.\r\n\r\nThe tower is equally great with storing the attachments, mounting the vacuum, and I love that it empties the vacuum whenever I hook it back up!\r\n\r\nOverall great design, great functionality and versatility, and well built with good materials.

      <td>The Cadillac of vacuum cleaners.</td>
      <td>1st of all I cannot believe I own such a fancy vacuum cleaner but let's get right into it. It comes with 2 batteries so one can be charging while you are using the other 1 it has 1 touch control.  So you just push the button to turn it on and off and it does all of the work for comes with 6 accessories attachments and bags for the. Self emptying feature.  It has a 5 step filtration system that filters 99% of the dust. It has a universal power nozzle. And detachable hand vacuum for quick easy spot cleaning if you have a little spill. The suction is incredibly powerful and incredibly quiet and it also comes with a 10 year limited warranty. You get a vacuum cleaner, telescoping wine,.  Universal power nozzle, power Mini nozzle, 2 quick release batteries, combination tool, crevice tool, extra pre filter, 3 tower. Bags and an owner's manual the only con I have for this is. I'm not sure where to get more tower bags or how much I will have to pay for those but other than that the.  Features and attachments are just blowing my mind now. This is coming from a previous shark vacuum owner and I am a die hard shark fan. But i'm still trying to find my socks because this vacuum has knocked them off!</td>

      <td>Expensive, convenient, could use some improvement</td>
      <td>I like this vacuum. I don't love this vacuum. And at this price point, I really should love it.Lot's of other reviews cover some great features, so I'm going to stick mostly to what I think needs improvement.CONS1) the regular roller attachment does not pick up on smooth surfaces well at all. I have my cat bowls in the kitchen and they often end up with cat food around them. When I'm vacuuming I take this to the kitchen to try to get all the bits of cat food, it seriously won't pick up any of the cat food on my floor. Something about the smooth floor and the largish object, it just won't. It pushes it around and that's very silly for a vacuum so expensive.2) I do love that they tried with the mop attachment but without heat I think it's kind of meh. I know it would probably be impossible to make it heated. The mopping experience is very lackluster. If you have anything stuck on your floor it takes a very long time for it to get it up. It's okay for a quick rinse but not a big cleaning.3) The weighting of this vacuum is a tad awkward. We have another similar style vacuum and the balance is much better. This one might be uncomfortable for folks who are less stable on their feet or aren't as strong (children, elderly, other mobility considerations).PROSThis is not an all inclusive list, there are many good things about it.1) the extendable wand is slightly longer than a very similar vacuum like this that we have. That makes it more comfortable for my partner to whole who is taller than me.2) Accessory storage. I think the actual stand is pretty ugly. But the fact that all the accessories store inside is pretty great.3) Suction on carpet is pretty good. Like I said, a bit dicey on harder floors for some reason but overall suction is pretty good (not amazing but pretty good).</td>

There are two batteries that come with it so you can change it out when one is done for uninterrupted cleaning. There is all in one tower. The tower serves as a battery charging station that charges two batteries. You can clean and charge them at the same time with 120 minutes.it also  conveniently and discretely stores tools and accessories. Inside the tower there is also an auto empty that empties the dirt cup when the vacuum is docked.there are three vacuum bags that come with it for emptying debris. it has Kompressor technology that compacts the dirt inside the dust bin. It has one touch press button that turns it on/off or you can select turbo power mode. The vacuum has a telescopic wand so you can adjust it to reach those high places. This vacuum is also a mop! It comes with mop heads and a power mop nozzle . You can mop hardwood floor with this and you can easily vacuum them too.

      <td>Love this Vac!</td>
      <td>I recently recieved this vacuum in the mail. It is perfect. It is lightweight and easy to use. It does not take up a lot of space and the attachments are easy stored inside the tower. Battery lasts about 30 minutes when running nonstop. There is also an extra battery if you need to vacuum longer. I love that I can take this vacuum anywhere without having to worry about tripping on a cord. The only problem I have found is that it does clog pretty easily but it is easy to unclog. The vacuum slides apart with a push of a button and you can remove the clogs. The suction power is really good and it also has different speeds of suction depending on what your cleaning. I highly recommend this vacuum especially for someone who isn’t able to lift much weight. I use it in my car, Rv and home with no problems. It also empties itself inside a bag that is stored in the tower so your not always having to empty it after each use.</td>

This cordless vacuum has so many amazing features and more suction power than any corded vacuum that I have ever used.The features are endless such as auto empty ,Kompressor technology that compresses the dirt in bin,washable filters,a 5 step filtration system plus many more. This cordless vacuum docks in a sleek,modern docking station that matches any decor and also holds up to 6 tools and 2 rechargeable batteries which gives you a whopping 2 hours of run time.\r\nI love that this vacuum can be used on different flooring surfaces, as I have hardwood and tile in my home and this literally sucks up everything leaving absolutely nothing behind. Not only is this the best vacuum that I have ever used,it also has an incredible 10 year warranty and has built in WI-FI so that you can connect to the LG APP to keep a cleaning schedule,run diagnostics,etc. Overall, this vacuum may be a bit pricey but is honestly worth every dollar and I would highly recommend it to everyone, including my family and friends.</td>

      <td>Compact rechargeable self emptying vacuum</td>
      <td>I found the LG CordZero All in One to be quite capable.  It cleans hardwood and tile easily.  Using the mop head to clean was a breeze on our hardwood and kitchen flooring. The battery life was good using only 1 bar after vacuuming the whole house.  I like how lightweight it is and makes cleaning the stairs fast and easy.  It struggles just a bit on low pile rugs, but was able to do the job. A pile adjustment would be a welcome addition. The turbo switch offers more suction when needed. The ability to use the vaccine without the stick extention is great for upholstry and automotive vacuuming. \nAs for looks the charging stand will be at home in any modern decor. The stand itself is clean looking and compact. The vacuum automatically empties it's contents and charges when it is docked. The stand hold the vacuum with the stick extension and vacuum head without disassembly. The accessories are stored neatly on the right side hidden from sight under the side door. The left side opens for filter and vacuum bag replacement.</td>

      <td>CordZero vacs are QUIET! Love Auto Empty bagging!</td>
      <td>We now have three households in our extended family with the Cord Zero all in one Auto Empty model.. I need encouragement to keep up with dusting, and so I appreciate the convenience ofa cordless vac but I hate dealing with emptying any Bagless vac which are the most popular these days. The feature of having bagged and filtered emptying into the recharging station is a great solution. By the way, the station also works for emptying other Cord Zero models, even the non-compressor units seem to work fine. So we keep our previous model upstairs and use the downstairs Auto Empty station for it as well.\r\n\r\nThe other big point, which LG doesn't seem to promote very much, is that these vacuums are notably quieter than most competitors. We previously had one of the competing models from the well known deluxe brand, and I hated it because it was so loud and very shrill sounding. The LG is deceptively powerful considering how much quieter it runs. Of course you can boost the speed, but even on Turbo the LG is not as hurtful to the ears. Note also that dogs and cats are more sensitive to loud high pitched noises than we are, they don't run away from this vacuum like they did with the other one. This quietness benefit is hard to prove from just reading the websites. Check out the Project Farm video comparison on YouTube where he reports the measured sound level of all tested units. LG is at or near the quietest and is still competitive in other performance categories.</td>

This is an outstanding vacuum no matter the user-friendly design, all the attached accessories, and the performance, all and all, this is the king!\r\nI mostly use a vacuum to clean up our house about twice a week, we have 50% carpet and 50% vinyl floor, with this vacuum I can use it on both surfaces.  \r\nThe auto empty charging station is so well-made and very user-friendly, you can store the extra tools inside the station. \r\nThe auto empty design is really impressive!  So convenient and really work perfectly, so after a few weeks, the vacuum still looks brand new!\r\nThe filter inside the vacuum is so easy to change or clean, there are so many extra nozzles and tools, all well-designed and high quality.\r\nThe most and the best is the owner's manual is so clear and easy to understand. \r\nOverall I highly recommend this vacuum!</td>

      <td>Expensive feature-rich with mediocre performance</td>
      <td>The LG Cordzero “all-in-one” system is an interesting (and expensive) idea that tries to accomplish all things you’d expect from vacuum cleaners. The package includes most of the items I’d usually need for everyday use, and the impressive base station, though being quite large and hefty, is feature rich. The attachments are good, and so is the ergonomics. It is a truly multifunctional tool.\nThe stick vacuum itself is well designed and well-balanced. The motor, near the top end, is very compact for its power and the telescopic handle makes it very easy to use. After using it to vacuum carpets and some tile floors I didn’t feel much fatigue compared to my other stick vacuums. The roller head (Universal Nozzle) can move around to reach a lot of hard to reach places. However, with “normal” operation I felt the suction power is not that great - with my “moderately clean” carpets with the usual dog hair etc. I frequently switched to the “Power” mode (and a few times to the “Turbo” mode). This drastically reduced the battery life and had to swap out the provided 2nd battery almost all the time. Without the 2nd battery and the charging station, this would have been a no-go from the very start. Of course, this depends on what type of carpets you have and how dirty they regularly get, but for me I’d appreciate it a bit more under Normal mode. But this is a drawback for almost all cordless vacuums I have used so far. The highly-touted Kompressor technology is just a manual lever that pushes down the debris inside dust bin. This helps pack more dust before I need emptying, but more me looked like an over-hyped idea. One thing to point out that the package does not include the slim hard-floor nozzle, so maybe that would be a better head to use for non-carpeted areas. However I did not have the means to try that out.\nAs for the Mop Nozzle - I have to say I’m quite disappointed with it. Only water can be used as the cleaning fluid, and the speed is fixed. This made it almost ineffective if there’s a speck of dirt in my tiled floor. For my use case, it was an ultra-low-duty attachment, and would only be useful if I could use it every single day. It is very very limited in its use, so if you plan to use it be wary.\nThe other “powered” head is the Pet Nozzle, which lists a lot of limitations in the manual (it can’t be used with clothing, bedding, leather sofas, cushions, carpet, vinyl flooring, tiles, marble) which made me wary to use it all. There are also crevice tools and a combination tool (crevice and brush) included as well which are very handy. Using these heads without the telescopic handle effectively transforms this into a handheld vacuum that I used to clean my car interior.\nThe charging/base station, as I mentioned earlier, is quite big and heavy. LF provides a plastic base with rubber feet to keep it standing, and mounting kit is there to tether it to a wall if needed. I did not have an issue with it as long it was not in a high-traffic area. The station, along with housing the stick vacuum, can charge the included extra battery, and has nifty ways to organize the tools/heads. The star feature is the Auto-empty functionality that automatically cleans out the dust bin from the vacuum body and puts it into a removable dust bag. I found the feature to be very useful (especially when I’m feeling lazy and wanted to create as little mess as possible) albeit noisy. By default the station performs this auto empty procedure every time the vacuum is docked, but this can be changed easily. The only drawback I saw was that the dust bag fills up quite easily and I’ll run out of those (only 3 are included) soon.\nIn terms of ease of use and smart features: I consider myself a tech-savvy person and am always looking forward to trying out new techs. But this vacuum left me baffled a number of times. For the first few days, I had to get the user manual to figure out what needs to be done. That’s the price you pay for getting a “feature” rich machine, but in my opinion this may leave people a bit frustrated. The LG ThingQ app does not add a lot of functionality - it can store cleaning history and can perform “Smart diagnosis”. But since I haven’t faced any functional issues with it I can’t comment how well it can actually solve problems.\nOverall, I like the LG Cordzero All-in-one system for trying to be an all-in-one solution. But I wish, for the price, I was getting a bit more performance. If you have a light-duty need this will be a very good solution, but given the price you have to really think about the pros and cons. This could have been great with the large feature-set, but its mediocre performance made it more gimmicky for my needs.</td>

      <td>LG make some fine products; this is not one of them.The user manual is terrible. To me the instructions are out of order. The line drawings are not clear. And in general it’s just bad. I thought the worst user manuals were in the software domain but this, relative to the complexity of the product, beats even the bad SW manuals.The stand requires too much space because of space required for doors on either side to swing out.There is very little actual vacuum even in turbo mode; it relies on the brushes to pick stuff up but then it cannot pull the stuff into the dust canister. Very light stuff (I think it’s carpet fibers mixed with dust does not pass into the dust canister and then backs up in the pipe between the floor brush part and the motor/vacuum part. The stuff in the pipe is easily blow out with a slight puff (which partially shows how poor the suction of the product is) but the stuff stuck in the motor unit that can’t get into the dust canister is nearly impossible to remove and it has to be done after about three minutes of use.This is a totally impractical product. I don’t know how LG let it go to market nor how it remains on the market (it probably won’t after all the suckers like me get burned).I have a vacuum cleaner I bought for $35 on sale at Walmart to use in a small condominium in Colorado that works far better that this. Moving the power cord of the $35 product, or my Panasonic and Hoover units I use at home, from outlet to outlet is a lot easier and done less frequently than fooling with the nearly impossible jams of this cordless unit.This came in so many parts and with such a poor user manual that I let it sit for a long time before attempting to assemble and use it. The Amazon return date has passed so I might take it to a thrift store for a slight tax deduction but I really hate to think about someone else wasting even far less money than I have on this product. Although, for me, this is not a significant financial hit, I am still angry that I have wasted nearly $1K on this thing (I guess I should be angry mostly at myself for letting the return date pass but the poor user manual contributed to this).I strongly recommend you stay away from this product.</td>

      <td>If I could give this ZERO stars, I would. The suction mechanism on this device is AWFUL. Wanna vacuum 4 pieces of sand and then 6 dog hairs? SORRY! YOU CAN'T! You have to repeatedly CLEAN OUT THE NOZZLE AFTER EVERY 2 SWIPES OF THE FLOOR.  The automatic cleaner doesn't empty the bin completely. Dirt falls out of the vacuum head when placing it back in the stand. Did you want to vacuum up that granule of laundry crystals? Here's how you can successfully get rid of the laundry crystal; after pushing it around with the vacuum head 67 times, pick the vacuum UP, and lay the head DIRECTLY on TOP of the crystal; when this doesn't work after 32 attempts, simply bend over and pick up the crystal with your HANDS then throw it in your garbage! Cinshy! We contacted LG about our issues and they asked us to return the vacuum. We waited 2 weeks to get the box. Another week to get the return label. It then took 3 weeks for them to "repair" the device and return it to us UNREPAIRED. SAME FREAKING ISSUES!!!!!!!!! If you like feeling rage and seeing red while vacuuming; if you enjoy having to tear apart and clean the suction nozzle on your vacuum every 5 seconds; if you enjoy slipping in your tears as you try to use this POS vacuum;  if you want to be borderline homicidal while trying to suck a piece of hair off your floor; if you love watching a thousand dollars go out the window, then this is the vacuum for you. Me, personally,  I hate it. It's awful. LG sucks. Their customer service sucks, too. Thanks for not just one, but TWO, crappy devices without suction. XOXO</td>

      <td>It’s a good vacuum</td>
      <td>I wanted to love this. I’d been so excited for it to arrive, and patiently waited for my husband to put it together. (Took him about 20 minutes.)  \r\n\r\nThe good:\r\n- it’s quiet. SO quiet, that I thought it wasn’t working, u til I noticed the internal dust cup filling up. \r\n- it’s lightweight. I have owned 2 other cordless vacuums and this one is the lightest by far. \r\n- since it vacuums itself, I have yet to have a clog - something that I was having frequently with other brands. \r\n- all of its accessories are stored right in the unit, making them easy to store and find when I need them. Again, other vacuum parts have been difficult to manage. \r\n- comes with 2 batteries. My house is small, so I’ve never run out of battery while using it. But having a spare on hand is very nice. \r\n\r\nRoom for improvement:\r\n- the dust cup is tiny. It fills up way faster than the battery runs out. \r\n- while it’s nice the height is adjustable, it only fits on the base at the smallest size. So it’s a bit tedious taking it on and off the base. \r\n- the internal dust storage bin is very small, and I really wish the bags were reusable. Seems very wasteful. \r\n- while it’s fancy that the vacuum cleans itself, it takes a silly amount of time to return to the base, lower the height, hook it on the base, and wait for it to empty. It’s much easier to walk to the nearest trash can, empty it, and continue cleaning. \r\n\r\nThis is a good vacuum. It works well. I can feel the intensity change as I move from carpet to hardwood and back again. I just don’t love it, some of the features seem a bit unnecessary. If you really want to have the fanciest vacuum available, this one absolutely suits you. If not, you may find it better to find something a bit less fancy.</td>

      <td>Fantastic features</td>
      <td>This vacuum is by far better than fantastic. The feature that this has are amazing. Let me start with the sucking power of this vacuum. When this is on normal it is strong and great for loose crumbs, pet hair , dirt, etc. click it up to turbo and it get down deep in the carpet for dirt a normal vacuum can’t get. Next let’s go to the battery life. 2 batteries are more than enough to clean an entire house (my house is 2800sq/ft) and I have battery to spare. Let’s move on to the accessories you get all the tools you need to clean furniture under heat registers to tight spaces behind fridges and under tables. The wet mop head is efficient in cleaning your hard floors to a great shine and clean the mop head is very easy. Now let’s go to the base, it hides all the tools neatly and it looks modern and no one would know what is in there. The base also sucks out the dirt from the unit into a bag in the base for a hands free cleaning of the dirt out of the unit. Finally the wi fi option is great. Get the app and it tell you how much the vacuum is used, when the batteries are fully charged, the last day you vacuumed, how long you vacuumed, etc. This is a very durable product and is well worth the purchase. I don’t know how I made it with out one of these. NO POWER CORDS is great as well. All wireless.</td>

      <td>Modern day cleaning system!</td>
      <td>The LG Cord Zero All-in-One Tower is not your standard stick vacuum, it's an entire cleaning system tucked away inside a modern piece of art!  Even before I used the cordless stick vacuum to clean my home, I instantly felt that my house improved a few notches by having this fancy and extra sleek all-in-one tower displayed proudly in my laundry room.  Not only does it it look beautiful, but it holds a myriad of tools and accessories that can be used to clean just about everything in your home. The suction of the vacuum is fantastic and the battery charge lasts for a very long time. An extra battery is included, but I haven't found it necessary since the charge hold is more than sufficient. The Vacuum itself is very light and it's easy to maneuver. \r\n\r\nAll of the six tools included in the tower have come in handy, but I especially love the  mop nozzle option.  It is super easy to use and only requires water while getting your tile and hardwoods spotless!  \r\nAnother favorite feature of the LG CordZero is that the vacuum is cordless so you don't have to worry about getting tangled up in cords. Not having to constantly rearrange cords makes along with not having to find outlets to replug as you move through your home makes cleaning a lot less daunting. Lastly, the vacuum automatically clears the dust and dirt into a collection bag within the tower so you can don't have to "clean up after you clean up"! I would definitely recommend the LG CordZero All-in-One tower to everyone, but especially for those who love to use all the latest and greatest technology and innovative products.</td>

      <td>I love it, but it the mop is a huge disappointment</td>
      <td>UPDATE: After a couple of months of use, this is my favorite vacuum to reach for and use. It's so convenient and easy to use. I finally filled my first bag and it was super easy to change and packed full of dust and debris that are no longer in my home... and not once did I have to shake debris out over an open trash can like other stick vacs. I still think they should've skipped including the mop but I found a small use for it when I had some construction dust on the floors. But as a quality of life changing simple yet powerful vacuum that doesn't make me constantly clean the cleaner I would rate this as 5 stars and very much worth the money.--------- ORIGINAL REVIEW --------Overall, if you are wanting a great stick vacuum (as long it's running on medium or high power), without all the dirty work of emptying out the dirt cup and money is no object then this is a great vacuum and I'd give at least 4.5 stars (I really wish it balanced better and you will eventually have to deep clean parts). But if you were considering a steam vac and hoping that this would do all... amazing vacuuming, storage, self cleaning AND also mop/sanitize your floors... forget about it. This is at best a damp mop without any real cleaning power. If you want this because of the mop feature I'd have to give it a low 3, it's not worth it and you really should consider that steam vacuum. It'd be nice if they offered this model without the mop attachment at a lower price.PROS:+ It's light and easy to use for vacuuming, one power button tap is all it takes to get it running+ Of the 3 levels of suction, the middle one is good and the top gear is very impressive. It will pull dirt in from a distance, much more than any other cordless vacuum (and even many corded ones).+ The self emptying feature removes the biggest common hassle among most stick vacuums. It's easy to use too, just drop it on and it takes care of the rest.+ The storage caddy has a place for everything (other than spare bags and pads)+ The spare charged battery means you never get caught with a dead battery mid clean.+ The debris compression lever is brilliant... It lets you run longer and solves the old hair wrapped around the filter problem common with other stick vacuums.NEUTRAL:* The Wifi feature is neat, I can see its charging status, care instructions, run a diagnosis and see the cleaning history all from the app. But none of that is terrible necessary.* The base, while great, does require you to dedicate a fairly significant amount of floor space, beyond it's square foot you need room on the sides for the large attachments to hang from and for the doors to open to get to the smaller accessories and the vacuum bag. You also need some space in the back for it to vent.* All stick vacuums seam to be guilty of it, but why so they provide such a worthless low power mode? I'm sure it's so they can advertise a 2 hour run time or some such nonsense... But it barely picks up large debris and when you turn it off it just falls back down the tube. Maybe for dusting delicate items? I'd much prefer the two useful power levels, one that's good enough for a several of decent sized rooms and another that will suck up killer dust bunnies.CONS:- The mop attachment is a joke. I'm not sure what the point of it is. It spins a rag that's a little damp? If you need to really clean hard floors, get a steam mop. For half the price you can get a killer vacuum and mop combination that really cleans and sanitizes the floor. This one does not get hot, does not allow detergents to be used, does not suction at the dirty water/grime, and barely has any scrubbing power. Maybe mine is defective, but it does light up and spin around?- It doesn't self stand or balance very well. I know a lot of premium stick mops don't but do they have to make them so awkward and top heavy that they are awkward to lean against a wall or chair for a short while? You could drop it back on its base, but that will start the self cleaning cycle and lock it into place for a couple minutes.- The manual makes several mentions of non replaceable filters or parts that will eventually need customer service to fix. In the base station in particular. This feels like an ominous time bomb waiting to put your expensive vacuum out of commission. Is it months, year or decades? No clue, but hopefully later rather than sooner.</td>

      <td>Best upright vacuum (better than Dyson)</td>
      <td>The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n I have a Dyson upright vacuum and a robot vacuum so I’d like to try this one and compare:Packaging: great packaging with every single part is well protected. It comes with three boxes which is nice to separate the parts (charging/self-emptying station, vacuum, and extra accessories).Design: the design is great. Nice color. I like the charging/self-emptying station so much. This is the only upright vacuum that has the self-emptying function. Totally hands-free from the dust and keeps the vacuum bin clean like new after each time use. It’s a pain that I need to dump the dust out with my Dyson, even though it’s not difficult. It’s very nice that the station can also be used to store all the extra accessories and make it look so nice and organized.Vacuuming: the suction power Turbo mode has a similar suction power as Dyson and much stronger than my robot. I have allergic asthma so I need a stronger one for my carpet bedroom and walk-in closet. My robot has self-emptying function too but is not strong enough. See the picture of how much dust it picked up right after I used my robot. I’m very happy with this one’s suction power. I also like that I just need to press the power button to start/stop the vacuum, rather than pressing the button all the time (very annoying) when I vacuum with the Dyson.Noise: even it’s on Turbo mode it’s still quiet than Dyson, which is great.Other: nice to have an extra battery as it’s advertised. It also comes with several dust bags.Overall I really like this self-emptying vacuum. Much better than Dyson. I’m going to buy the mop and see how it works for the hard floors and tiles.</td>

      <td>Easy Vacuum and Mop Tool</td>
      <td>If nothing else, this is so easy to do a quick cleanup or whole house vacuuming. It's relatively quiet and the suction is adequate. If you have a lot of pet hair, you'll probably need to empty the chamber during cleaning. That's easy to do, it just pops open and dumps into your trash. This is *not* a good unit for picking up large debris on the floor. \n\nThis vacuum/mopping system has replaced several cleaning tools. Our big vacuum, my little "car vacuum" and our damp mop. I vacuum the house, we used a robot vac for a few years, it took too long to straighten up for its use to make it a labor-saving device. I can vacuum with this and it does as good a job as the robot and I spend hardly more effort. \n\nIt cleans rugs well, it's a bit of a clickity-clackity on tile, but it also vacuums it well. \n\nThe width and height of the head allow me to get under almost everything in our house. \n\nI was initially amazed at how much dust, hair, and dirt the robot vac got up off of our seemingly clean floors. This vacuum does the same thing, perhaps a little more. So I know it's doing a good job. \n\nOnly once thus far have I used it long enough to run out of battery power and have to swap batteries. So it's got a pretty long runtime. We have a 2400 sq/ft house. Tile, bamboo, and carpet. \n\nThis fits into a really small corner of our house. Those are standard vertical blinds in the picture. \n\nIt gets a 4/5 for less than stellar suction and large particle cleanup.</td>

      <td>Hands Down the Best Cordless Vacuum</td>
      <td>I have had this vacuum for over a year and it is absolutely fantastic. Prior to this purchase I had two Dyson V10’s. Why two you may ask….because the Dyson doesn’t have a removable battery and basically lasts minutes. I was so frustrated using my Dyson….keeping it on low power and rushing to get the house vacuumed before it ran out of power. Then I bought this LG. It came with two batteries but I have yet to ever switch before finishing the house.The genius part of the LG system is that it empties itself out…..actually it vacuums itself out so it pulls all the dust and dirt out of the vacuum and filters. As far as using it….it’s perfectly balanced and moves like it was on ice. I also don’t get the Dyson finger bump (which you would know if you used the V10).I’ve used the LG mop attachment which is pretty good for getting kitchen floors cleaned but isn’t perfect. It’s a light duty mop.Over all this system is slick. Replacement batteries are awesome, the self cleaning feature is awesome, and the charging station fits perfectly anywhere and looks slick.This is well worth the price and is a great tool.</td>

      <td>Amazing, that's all I can think of to say!</td>
      <td>It was so easy to get everything set up and OMG I've never used such a strong vacuum in a stick before.  The thing I have never seen anyone mention is the corner cleaning.  One of the first things I noticed was that when I went along side a wall, that dirt was picked up very well.  I didn't have to go back in to the corners and brush things out it was just all gone!\r\n\r\nIt's a little heavier than I expected, but still very light and manageable even with my arthritis.\r\n\r\nHaving asthma, one of the hardest things about vacuuming for me was that I had to wait for my husband to get home to take it outside and empty the old ones before I could continue.  I don't have to worry about that anymore with this new vacuum because it does it all itself  How simple can it get!\r\n\r\nThe speed of the machine on it's normal setting is more than adequate for my needs.  Works great on my ceramic tile floors, wood floors and carpeting.  I'm good to go! Merry Christmas to me for sure!\r\n\r\nI can't thank you enough for creating this vacuum.  It was definitely on the high priced end, but I think that purchase will be more than worth it!</td>

      <td>The vacuum that does it all</td>
      <td>I gotta admit, I'm a sucker for a great vacuum.  I have 3 cats, 2 rooms with carpet and lots of furniture so a great vacuum is a must for me.  I need to be great at 3 things: picking up cat hair from carpet and furniture, it needs to be great on hardwood for various cleanups, it must be light and convenient to use, and of course, it needs to be cordless. This new LG checks all of those boxes plus it has a mop! \n\nDo not be scared off by the giant, heavy box that this comes in.  The tower that holds everything is incredibly easy to set up and the instructions are very detailed.  I had this up and running within 15 minutes.  I love how the tower holds all of the attachments plus an extra battery so I will never run out of juice.\n\nThe vacuum is light, powerful and does everything I need.  It picks up cat hair and litter with ease and does a great job on my carpeted floors.  The battery life is fantastic and the turbo modes give me the extra power when I need.\n\nThe tower works to empty the vacuum automatically so there is nothing stopping me from cleaning.  The mop feature is pretty cool too.  I have very shiny floors and it is tough to get them looking good, but this did the job well for quick cleanups.\n\nI could not be happier with this system and look forward to many years of use.</td>

      <td>To give you a idea i have had 4 different battery power dysons starting with V7 to v12 all in matter of monthes lose turbo mode. Now Lg love how it works spare battery does wonders for extra cleaning. Compressor knob is awesome(plastic though). Best of all it self cleans when your full at the station. Test average 85-87mins of run time on auto low rugs, 55ish on lvl 2/65% pwr and about 25mins on full mode using both batteries. Found auto suction is as good has lvl2 from dysons v11 animal edition. So far have had this since black friday 2022 batteries are holding up to weekly use/drain. Now for a few con's only 2 things i find bad is wifi connection(needed to monitor vacuum bags and recommend maintenance updates yes lg app tells you maintenance) and the bags themselves. You have to buy extra bags to make this vacuum useable you can still drop into trash can. Thats the reason for the 4/5 stars. Other than that technology on this vacuum is awesome. For those thinking about house size 2story 2100+sqft house 80% carpet upstairs and 30% downstairs after vacuuming still have 20% left in 2nd battery on auto.</td>

      <td>Almost perfect Whole Home Vacuum</td>
      <td>Vacuum for the whole home. I have 2 regular vacuums. A stick vacuum and a small cordless D***Bust** vacuum. I was hoping this would replace them so I can have one system to clean all the areas of our busy home. The setup was pretty easy but there was not a master set of instructions, so it was just open this and find out where it goes kind of install. After 20 minutes it was complete. I did have extra parts but they were for replacement filters and maintenance as I found in the manual. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app and paired the unit to my phone. Took about 15 minutes and 2 tries but finally connected. \n\nUse: I like the main vacuum brush for cleaning the main area of the home. The whole unit is comfortable to hold and not too heavy. I like that it is just small enough to fit in all the areas in my home where we vacuum. Most of the floor is Tile and LVT. We also have pets so there tends to be a lot of hair to pick up. In the first use I filled the container up in 20 minutes. There was a beeping noise to alert me that it was full. I set it in the base unit, and it auto emptied. This was where everything started to click. I can just pick it up vacuum and set it in the base when it is full. That is all. Not having to plug in the wall and hold the cord was helpful in getting the chore done fast. Then I used the smaller brush attachment to clean the harder to reach areas of the floor. Each time emptying in the base unit. Finally, I attached the mop unit and mopped the floor. It seemed like it would polish the floor and take up any shoe marks, but I did not notice any benefit from the mopping function. The following days I used it to clean little area’s that I would see more pet hair building. Just being able to grab and go is nice. I feel like this is almost perfect. I wish there were more color options and that the main brush unit was a little wider. In all it keeps my 2900 sq ft home clean and both batteries are more than enough to clean it.\n\nPros:\nCordless\nCondenses multiple cleaning tools\nLight weight\nLong battery life\nAuto Empties waste\n\nCons:\nWish it was less dust prone on the top of the base unit\nWish there were more colors\nWish the Mop function was stronger\nWish the Container held more</td>

      <td>I’ll start by saying, I’d never have bought myself this vacuum as it is pretty cost prohibitive. My mother bought it for me as a gift and I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It has better suction than I expected it would. And since it is lightweight, I grab it almost everyday instead of a broom for my tile floors and instead of my bulky vacuum for carpets.By far, the most valuable feature is the fact that u don’t have to open that canister to empty it out. I’ve had other stick vacuums in the past that, while emptying it, I usually felt that I was just spreading all the contents around again. When u dock this vacuum, all the contents r sucked into an internal bag. My FAVORITE feature.I have 2 greyhounds that seem to continuously shed fur. So the ability to grab this vacuum rather push the fur around with a broom is much better.I’ve never tried the mop feature as it seems sort of pointless to me…which is maybe why this thing is priced so high.Like I said, I would never pay $1000 for a vacuum… but I LOVE the self-emptying feature… and it’s suction power will surprise!</td>

      <td>I've had this just over a week and absolutely love it! Is it the strongest, most powerful vacuum that'll efficiently do shag carpets? No. But it's great for picking up cat litter off the vinyl floor and I've been more apt to do that with this cordless beauty. I threw away my little broom I used to use. I'm not sure what I like best the cordless feature or the self-cleaning feature. \r\nAlso I like the mop! Is it the best? Again, no. But it's sufficient for small areas at a time. It's a bit slow but on my vinyl flooring it works fairly well. \r\nI was nervous to spend the amount I spent on this but I'm glad I did thus far!!</td>

      <td>I needed to replace my old stick vac after not being satisfied with its pickup and performance. I went to Abt store  and tested all the vacuums on display. The one that stood out was the LG A9. After buying one and using it for a week, it has very good suction (even on the lowest setting) plus 2 boost modes, pickup of fine dust, fur and large bits is great on carpets, the body is light and easy to carry around and it runs quieter than other vacuums due to the inverter motor. The filter is easy to access from the top of the main unit and comes with a spare. The wall mounted charge dock is convenient. The brush hasn't tangled with any hair yet. Overall this is a great choice in the stick vacuum world.</td>

I love how the attachments store in the stand so they won't get lost. Also the self emptying is so cool. My husband is looking forward to using it to vacuum out his truck since it can also be a hand vac. I cannot recommend this enough! It makes vacuuming fun and my kids actually WANT to vacuum.

      <td>A bit pricey but great vacuum for your home</td>
      <td>This is more of a vacuum station than just a regular old vacuum. It's a bit pricey but it's still a great vacuum for your home. \n\nThis is your typical stick vac with a auto-emptying hub. It's quite nice in that you can empty the vacuum manually however, the base station had a feature where you can auto-empty it whenever you dock the vacuum. The base station itself looks good and looks refined. It's not just some gaudy tower that you shove in a corner and have it looking like an eye sore. With the different color options, you could color coordinate it with your decor if you wanted to so that it's stands out less. the footprint of the base station is pretty small so you can store it anywhere really without it getting in the way. \n\nIncluded with the vacuum are your usual attachments like a crevice tool as well as a floor scrubber which is nice. It doesn't vacuum up the liquid so it's really just a scrubber. There is a separate head attachment for the scrubber as well as some extra velcro pads to use on the scrubbing head. The attachments store inside the base station except the scrubbing head which attaches to the side. This also comes with an extra bag and filter for the vacuum. \n\nAnother nice feature is the extra battery. You store/charge the battery in the top of the unit so if you need to vacuum the whole place, you won't have to worry about running out of power midway through. This works ok for cleaning out your automobile too since it's portable however it's a tab bulky to get into some corners. \n\nLast feature is the compressor. With practically all these bagless vacuums, the center filter eventually gets clogged with debris so you need to disassemble the unit and clean that out properly to ensure proper suction. There is a lever on the bin that moves up and down on the compressor which allows you to scrape off a good chunk of debris on the interior filter without needing to disassemble it which I found to be quite beneficial. You'll still need to disassemble the unit for proper maintenance however, with this cleaner, you can do it far less. \n\nOnly real knock to the is the price tag. It is expensive for a vacuum and you could easily find a stick vac or even a larger corded vacuum for much cheaper. That said, this is more of a lifestyle item where you can have a great functioning vacuum and have it look good in your home.</td>

      <td>Outstanding stick vacuum!</td>
      <td>We have more than a few vacuums in our home, multiple stick vac’s from the other brands, as well as canisters, and shop-vacs. This one takes the cake as my new favorite. First impression is that it LOOKS great, I hardly want to move it to a closet or the laundry room because it is so sleek looking. The tower holds all accessories, which is awesome because if they don’t have a place they usually get lost in my house, only to be found 3 years later. Also, the auto empty feature of the tower is just awesome. The other stick vacs that I have used were always a pain to empty, and I would wind up getting dirt and dust all over the garbage can, or the floor that I just cleaned. Now everything is contained. Right from the vacuum to a large bag in the tower! This LG vacuum is also a breeze to use, it feels balanced in my hand. The telescoping tube is a great feature, and allows me to clean without bending over (I’m 6 foot tall). As for power, there is no shortage. Just on the normal mode it does a great job, but when you turn on turbo there is a noticeable difference in power. This difference in power makes it slightly louder, but still not as loud as other vacuums we own. The kompressor feature is also a great addition. As you’re vacuuming you can push all the dust and pet hair collected down, leaving more room before emptying. Which is externally helpful if you live in a house that doubles as a zoo like us (2 dogs, a cat, a snake, a lizard, and of course three kids under 13). The tower also holds an additional battery, which stays charged for longer cleaning. All you have to do is open the top, and swap out the awaiting battery, and off you go! Great idea! The app is a nice feature to have, it logs the cleaning time and amount used. It also can notify you on when filters need to be cleaned and changed. The app also tells you the battery life remaining, and when the unit has finished charging. All in all I love this new vacuum, and would recommend it to anyone with a larger home looking for a stick vac!</td>

      <td>We decided to splurge on an expensive cordless vacuum to help keep the fur from our dogs in check. This vacuum started out really good, I even liked using the vacuum. We kept the machine clean and really thought it was just what we needed for our two story house. Right before the one year warranty was up a part broke on it. Even though it was just a small part easily reparable the only way to fix it was to send the vacuum back to the service dept. No big deal I wasn’t paying for it and we still had the back up corded vacuum to get by, Now two months later the whole tower is not working and now I have to pay for it. 200.00 and I have to send the whole unit back. This is not an easy thing to do. On top of that the customer service is very disorganized, I do need to call customer service and be asked if “the unit is plugged in?” As reason it is not working. I was on and off the phone for 45 mins and transferred 4 times. I have 3 LG tv’s and a washer and dryer, pretty disappointed by the vacuum, time to move on.</td>

      <td>Awesome vacuum tower</td>
      <td>The LG cordless zero A9 k is a beast of a machine. There are so many functions of this vacuum also mop that it’s hard to take it all in. The mop pads are super easy to connect disconnect take off and clean. Adding water to the tank is easy as well. It’s not a big water tank so using all of the water and cleaning out the tank makes for a cleaner reuse. Make sure you dry the water tank. The Wi-Fi is easy to connect if you have the app. I don’t use it because I don’t need it. But it is a good option. I put together the entire tower in less than 10 minutes. I like that it comes with two batteries. Straight out of the box I was able to vacuum part of my house. Charging takes overnight but  it also depends on what mode you use. Regular mode isn’t enough to pick up all of the dog hair. Power mode is a good option and last between 20 and 30 minutes.\nTurbo mode only last seven minutes but it does pick up larger items. The fact that you have a second battery is also very helpful. The nozzles are able to be used on furniture and I can take it outside and use it in my car. The sound is fairly loud when you hook up the vacuum to the tower for the automatic empty. Not a big issue. I really like the compressor system because I’m able to vacuum a lot more without emptying more often. Overall this is a great vacuum I am unsure about the filter bags since we have a puppy we will go through a lot of them.</td>

      <td>AUTOMATIC EMPTYING INTO A BAG!</td>
      <td>I received this vacuum about a week ago, and I’ve been using it for every day cleaning of my entire house. It has powerful suction, and it’s much quieter than cordless vacuums I’ve purchased previously. My favorite feature is the self-empty base, which automatically empties the contents of the dust bin into a sealed bag. No longer do I have to touch the contents of the dust bin, which will always be a plus. I simply remove, and throw away the bag, then insert a new bag into the self-empty base. Let’s not forget that the vacuum comes with not one, but two batteries that I can swap when one runs out of juice. The self-empty base will charge the additional battery while I’m vacuuming. With this vacuum I can track my cleaning history over Wi-Fi with the LG ThinQ app. Unfortunately, it isn’t without flaws, and requires improvement. Prepare to cut and/or remove long hair from the brushroll. It’s best to have a nozzle that prevents long hair from wrapping around the brushroll. Also there’s no illumination on the nozzle so I can’t see what I’m vacuuming.</td>

      <td>Could be better on carpets</td>
      <td>This is a very expensive product and I cannot give it more than two stars. The base had a crack in it when the product arrived and it is something that I did not expect from a 1000 dollar product. Extra headache consumes time and I hope this was just a one--off incident.\n\nIt took me around 20 minutes to get the parts out of the boxes, read the directions (two separate booklets: one for the vacuum and one for the charging station. It took me around 30 seconds to put everything together. Unfortunately, the base of the charging station came broken in the box. The charging station has a smart bento box-like design where the parts can be inserted when not in use. There are three different insets for dry vacuum (regular), mopping, and narrower head to reach into corners. The last one is great for staircases, between car seats, and floor corners. The set up looks nifty and cute The battery charger works fast, battery life is good, self-cleaning mechanism of the dust works fine.\n\nWhile the good looking, moderately heavy, good picker-up-er works well for lighter cleaning on hardwood floor, it could not handle my pet’s fur on carpet. The machine got stuck every few minutes and I had to open the top nozzle and clean out the rod with disposable chop sticks. My kids love crafting and carpeted floor in their room is always full of bits of paper. The bits of paper and the dog fur worked together and chocked the pipe after every two minutes. I will probably use this on hardwood floors, the car, and stairs only.\n\nThe function of the wi-fi is unclear to me and I am not sure if I will ever need to use the wifi. The placement of the turbo and wi-fi switches are a problem. It should probably be above the on/off switch instead of below. Or may be on the sides. While vacuuming, my hand kept hitting the turbo and that was a little annoying. Because of its top-heavy design, the vacuum cannot be kept anywhere in upright position except for the charging station. If you lean it on the wall, it will slide down because of the heaviness of the motor. \n\nThis small expensive fancy thing is good for light clean ups but unsuitable for carpeted floors in with furries and messy kids, which is a big disappointment at this price-point.</td>

The suction is very weak and does not pick up bigger pieces of trash, it just moves it around your floor. This product does a bad job with dog hair as well. The mopping attachment is horrible and does not work. I tried to get in touch with LG Support and never got the issue resolved. The mop attachment is one of the main reasons in us purchasing this product, thus not worth it at all.. The only positive thing is the actual auto empty pedestal.

      <td>The All In One of Vacuums</td>
      <td>I have tried several vacuums and they have all their pros and cons. This is a very well designed and thought out system. It ranges from a compact vacuum cleaner to powerful upright with telescoping tubes for easy storage. \n\nThe charging station serves multiple purposes as it holds the main unit, charges the vacuum, stores a charged spare battery, empires the dust compartment and has ample storage for the attachments.  The machine snaps right in place and plays a tone to assure you that it’s in place.  \n\nThe vacuum itself does a nice job on all surfaces. It has a power button to up the suction, but the normal setting works well for most jobs.  The cleaning head is smaller than normal, but this is a big plus for cleaning around corners, under furniture and other tight spots.  \n\nOne feature that really separates from the others is the spinning polishing head.  It has a water compartment with two spinning cloth pads to polish and clean linoleum, tile and wood floors. With two settings for water flow, it never saturated the floor and did a great job of putting just the right amount of moisture to do the job. The pads are easily removable and can be cleaned and reused.  \n\nFinally, the battery life seems to be very good. I have been testing it for almost a week and I have yet to see the battery meter move.  \n\nIf you’re looking for an all in one solution, this is it.</td>

      <td>Quiet, Great Vacuum, Eh Mop, Proprietary Bags</td>
      <td>Wow, I was not expecting so many parts and pieces to arrive in such a large box. After getting over my initial shock, everything was pretty straightforward to put together and all of the components and attachments either store in or hang on the base, so it doesn't take up as much room as I feared.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum itself is deceptively quiet and works great. We have a similar style stick vacuum from another well known brand and it must be 2-3 times louder than this vacuum, but seems to perform the same. We have a dog that'll dash out the doggy door when our old vacuum turns on. With this vacuum, she's still not pleased, but she'll hang out one room over instead of making a beeline for the backyard.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum itself comes with a number of attachments-- a general floor head (with spinning brushes) a narrower pet hair head (with spinning rubber flaps) and a mop (no suction, just rotating pads). It also has the usual brush, crevice tool, etc. One cool thing worth mentioning is that the aluminum tube (between the vacuum and head) is extendable, so this is actually comfortable to use while standing-- you don't have to hunch over.\r\n\r\nFor performance, I find that you can get about 15 minutes out of one battery on the highest speed, but closer to 45 minutes with the lowest speed-- which has more than enough power for hardwood floors, etc. This set also comes with a spare battery (that sits under the lid of the storage tower and is always charged), so you can actually get some cleaning done in between charges.\r\n\r\nThe general flooring head with the bristles works well-- it picks up pretty much everything. The rubber flap head for pet hair is okay. It does good for hair that is fresh on the surface (so couches, car seats, etc)-- but it does not work miracles. If you have a rug with hair that's worked in over the past 2 years and is really embedded in there, not much will get it out, including this head.\r\n\r\nThe mop head is a bit of a disappointment. It has a small reservoir, you can't use hot water, and you can only use plain water (no cleaning solutions). Because of this, it's really limited in its usefulness for me.\r\n\r\nFinally, the base/storage station is pretty slick. It always keeps the vacuum charged (expected), does a good job at holding all the accessories (good design), but the real feature is the auto emptying of the hand vac. If it's in AUTO mode, as soon as you dock the vacuum, it pops it open, sucks out all the dust and gets it ready to go again. I turned it off of AUTO because it is loud. It's basically as loud as a corded vacuum cleaner when it goes off. Overall, I love it. My only disappointment is that it empties the vacuum into a proprietary LG vacuum bag that they are currently pretty proud of. Hopefully a third party comes out with a more economical choice in the future.\r\n\r\nSo, final verdict? I love it, it's sleek, works well, is quiet, and is well thought out. Don't buy it for the mop feature (more of a gimmick in my eyes) and do be aware of the ongoing costs of the proprietary bags (though you can manually empty the vac into your own trash can, but that kind of negates the best feature of this system-- the auto emptying), but if you can get past those, then I think you'll really like what LG did with this product.</td>

      <td>This LG CordZero vacuum is a lot quieter than my other cordless vacuum but it cleans well. \r\nThe charging stand is my favorite! I usually lose the attachment pieces but this holds almost all of the attachments including the extra battery.\r\nI also love the auto empty feature and the mop feature. I would definitely recommend this to everyone!</td>

      <td>Absolutely Amazing!</td>
      <td>Let me start off by saying this is the absolute best vacuum by far. My husband was skeptical that a cordless vacuum could clean our carpets better than a traditional plug-in vacuum. He vacuumed our bedroom with the other vacuum (a very expensive and highly rated). When he was done, I took the LG CordZero and went back over the carpet. Wow! I got quite a bit in the canister. My husband was impressed. I also love that the stand has self-cleaning. The dust that you typically have to deal with is non-existent when emptying out. I am so thrilled with this vacuum. I have not yet had the opportunity to use the mop feature on our hardwoods. I cannot believe I’m about to say this, but I cannot wait to mop my floors! Do yourself a favor, and go ahead and purchase the LG CordZero.</td>

      <td>Best vacuum I've ever used</td>
      <td>WOW! This LG cordzero blows away any Dyson I've ever had (I've had 3 models) and the Shark that I most recently started using. It is quieter, the auto empty feature is downright amazing, and it has a perfect amount of power to pick up the hair from my 2 dogs plus all the grass clippings that inevitably get tracked into the house. \r\n\r\nI haven't even tried the mopping option yet, but I am sure it's amazing as well. \r\n\r\nI will say that the amount of instructions that come with this device are plentiful - so many different instruction booklets and cards made it a little confusing but I guess when it comes to directions for a new device, more is better than less. \r\n\r\nI love how this vacuum is small enough to fit under furniture, like beds, to clean. Also it's sleek appearance has me not even minding that it sits out in the living room! It does have to be plugged in so it can charge - which makes storing it in a closet difficult. But it's so nice looking that it doesn't even matter. \r\n\r\nI recommend this over and over - I am geeky excited to have this new vacuum in my arsenal!</td>

The worst part is when you insert it back to the base it is supposed to empty into a bag.  It runs through the cycle and all however, it does not empty into the bag.  Twice, the canister opened tossing the contents all over the place.  I can't seem to figure out what is wrong.  It plays the music when inserted correctly and I hear the suctioning but nothing.  For the amount of money I spent on this vacuum it should be better.  I miss my shark I gave away.  If I had kept the boxes, I would send it back.</td>

      <td>The tower is definitely an interesting conversation piece. It currently sits in my dining room, where it has plenty of space to stand out. I must say, the tower is quite sturdy and complements any decor beautifully. It not only serves as a storage area for the spare battery but also provides a special spot for all the additional attachments. Once you're done vacuuming, simply press the button on the tower, and it will effortlessly empty the debris from the vacuum, conveniently storing the vacuum itself.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the vacuum itself. It's a typical stick vacuum, but what's impressive is how quiet it is. It's by far the quietest vacuum I've ever used, and its lightweight design makes it ideal for quick and easy clean-ups. It's especially efficient at picking up dust, small crumbs, and pet hair. The lightweight feature also makes it a breeze to clean furniture and tackle stairs in the house. In terms of suction power, it performs admirably in regular mode. If you need some extra oomph, there's a turbo mode available that provides a significant boost in suction power, although it does come with increased noise and power consumption. The turbo mode drains a fully charged battery in about 10 minutes, so it's better suited for shorter cleaning sessions. Thankfully, the battery lasts much longer when using the regular mode. As a mother of young kids, I must admit that I was slightly disappointed with its ability to handle larger crumbs with ease. Additionally, I found it a bit challenging to push on my rugs compared to hard surface floors.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a great lightweight stick vacuum that works wonders for quick cleaning on hard surface floors and furniture. The tower is a practical addition, ensuring that the vacuum is always conveniently ready for use. Plus, having an extra battery is a real lifesaver, providing ample power to meet all your vacuuming needs. Personally, I particularly appreciate the tower's self-emptying function, the option to switch batteries, and the storage space for all the additional accessories.</td>

      <td>This thing is amazing!</td>
      <td>I was skeptical when I ordered the LG CordZero but the more I read about it the more I wanted to try it out.  With two old dogs (17 and 23… yup. That’s right) I vacuum every single day of my life. The biggest issue was having to pull the vacuum out, constantly unplug it to move it it around the house and then wrap the cord up and put it back up. It was a royal pain. \r\n\r\nI honestly thought I wouldn’t have the power with a cordless option, but it’s not the case in the slightest.  The best part is I have the tower in the living room and it looks great. Modern, out of the way yet very convenient to use and  It recharges quickly. I’ve yet to have to use the second battery. The attachments are out of the way and seem to work great as well. \r\n\r\nIt is absolutely worth the investment. \r\n\r\nSo far, I’m very impressed and look forward to using it.</td>

      <td>Nice and handy Vacuum</td>
      <td>I bought this vacuum 2 weeks ago. In summary:\r\n1. Easy to set up, took 30 mins\r\n2. Very light, so if you are old and worried about holding it, it is easy to use \r\n3. Has good joints, which makes good to difficult areas to reach\r\n4. Has strong suction\r\n5 comes with many tools that you can use\r\n6. Has auto emptying feature, which is really nice \r\n7. My wife likes it and my wife tends not to like things I buy much !</td>

      <td>I really liked it, but the base of the tower was cracked, and I had to send it back!  I tried everything except the wet mop.  I really didn't expect to get much up, because I vacuumed last week (only 2 clean freaks in the house).  Much to my surprise, it pulled up a lot of stuff!  It was easy to unpack.  The tower houses all the tools.  The cleaning function worked great.  It emptied all the dirt.  I read all the instructions, which I think is important for running it at it's best.  I'll be ordering a new one.  My only negatives are that the vacuum heads seem cheaply made for the money.  The plastic seems like it will break easily.  The battery does run down quickly on power modes, and it did start feeling heavy by the time I was done vacuuming 3600 Sq Ft.</td>

      <td>Mukman</td>
      <td>Nice Multi Use Vacuum</td>
      <td>Set up and instructions were easy to follow.\n\nLG even supplies 2 quick access cards with all the assembly and maintenance items needed. Well formatted and written.\n\nYou also can download an app called LG ThinQ to your phone. This is a smart home app for all things LG.  It allows you to see the usage of the vacuum, charge status, run diagnostic and shop at LG store. (As of the writing of this review, I could not find the filter bags at the LG store)\n\nAs quick overview, below are my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n•\tGood Suction levels\n•\tRolls Nice – Head stays down\n•\tGood battery life when in default mode\n•\tNO CORD\n•\tSelf-Cleaning\n•\tLight weight\n•\tExtra battery with onboard charging\n•\tHidden tool storage\n•\tEasy extend/disconnect buttons\n•\tOn/off Power button\n\nCons:\n•\tOnly 9” wide brush\n•\tFilter bag cost\n•\tMop head unit disappointing\n•\tWould like larger collection bag or canister (People with pets)\n•\tWill push around larger items like cereal/pretzels on hardwood floors\n\nOverall, I really like this, LG CordZero. It does the job well for what is designed for. The Self-cleaning tower is probably the most impressive feature.\n\n \nAs mentioned above (in Cons) the only small tweaks I would prefer is to make the head a little larger to cover more area at a time. The small size does have the advantage of getting between items like chairs though.\n\n\n I would also like to see either larger holding bag in the self-cleaning unit, or a canister you could just dump out. \nWe have two dogs that shed, so the cleaning bag located in the self-cleaning stand will fill up quickly. \nI have used this about 10 times and the bag is almost full.\nThis will result in an added expense, so I do wish this bag was larger, or less cost for replacements. I found the bags online at $19.99 for a pack of three. (Thee came with the unit). If you have no animals, this will not be a problem for you.\n\n\nExperience with cleaning: \n\nThe stick itself is easy to extend with the push of a button. Much easier than other units I have tested.\nYou can easily add the accessory pieces to reach into ceiling corners etc. I did use the brush accessory to clean our ceiling fan grills and found that I had to use the turbo mode to prevent the dust from just falling on my head. All other vacuuming, I have used the default mode and it seemed to clean well.\n\n\nWhat my wife noticed early on is that this unit will clean the light bathroom rugs without sucking them into the head unit like others do. Best vacuum so far at this task.\n\n\nMy experience with cleaning hardwood floors is that if you have normal dirt, it cleaned fine. If you had a larger piece of dried food, such as broken pretzel or a piece of cereal, the head unit would just push it around. If you need to pick those items up, I found if I simply picked up the head and pulled backwards over the debris, it picked up fine. I did use the Power mode for more suction.\n\n\nCarpet cleaning worked well in normal mode.\n\n\nThe power and function switches are located on the top. No need to hold the button down to clean like some other units. You can hit the plus button for more suction and minus for less. If you hold the plus button down for three seconds you get into turbo mode. This has incredible suction but will drain your battery quickly.\n\nBattery Max run time as indicated on the supplied card:\nUsing nozzle:\nTurbo Mode – 6  Minutes\nPower Mode – 20 Minutes\nNormal Mode – 40 Minutes\n\nUsing a tool:\nTurbo Mode – 7  Minutes\nPower Mode – 30 Minutes\nNormal Mode – 60 Minutes\n\n\nThe self-cleaning tower unit has a clean look, stores all your tools, and does a great job emptying the canister. It stands 40” tall and need to plug into the wall outlet. It stores all accessories and holds and charges the spare battery and the vacuum.\n\nEvery time you store the vacuum, you need to retract the stick and place into the base. Automatically the unit will empty the canister. This is a little loud but only last about 30 seconds. You can press the start/stop button on the top of the tower to bypass this if you like.\n\n\nThe Kompressor slider is nice feature. It allows you to compact the dirt in the canister using a simple slider lever, allowing more use between having to empty. Also allows you to discharge dirt when manually emptying the canister. Other units I have tested lack this feature and forces you to use a tool or your fingers to get all the dirt out. Nice job LG.\n\nSpeaking of tools, LG does include a small brush to clean out the canister when doing maintenance.\n\nFilters appear easy to maintain and do an awesome job filtering out the dust and allergen particles.\n\n\n\nMop Head feature:\n\nWe did not find this super useful. It does an okay job laying water down on the floor to maybe remove something items the vacuum could not, but if has no option to spot treat with a little extra water like some mop units. The head has three water dispensing settings, Off, Low & High.\nYou are instructed to only fill the reservoir with water. We may try spraying some floor cleaner down first to see if we get better results. \nYou must go slow when cleaning as well. After we cleaned the kitchen floor, we then ran a swiffer over the area and found it picked up quite a bit of dirt. So not sure this mop head will be used much for us.\n\nSo, final thoughts. I would say for a house mostly with carpet or hard floors with standard debris, this is a nice unit. The self-empty feature is fantastic.\n\nIf you have mostly hardwood, with kids that drop cereal or such larger (Pea size of large) items on the floor that you would like to pick up with the vacuum, there might be better choices such as vacuums with front soft roller, or other method to pick up larger items.\nIf you have mostly carpet and want a universal vacuum that can do your daily tasks, has a tower that can not only store and charge the vacuum but can also self-empty and hold all the accessories PLUS another battery. Then you might consider this LG CordZero All in One Auto Empty.\nIf the auto empty is not a feature you need, LG does offer other options for less cost.\n\nWarranty – 1 year parts and labor, but 10 year on the Inverter motor.\n\n~Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews</td>

      <td>Wow!  Just Wow!</td>
      <td>This is an incredible vacuum, especially for a cordless stick vacuum! I am totally in love with it! Not only does it have storage right there on the sides for all the attachments, but the entire unit is sleek and, dare I say, sexy.  As for performance, it's outstanding. I thought I would only use this on the hard floors and the basement with the Berber carpeting, but it did a great job on my plush carpeting upstairs, too! It's quieter than my last vacuum, has good suction, transitions from carpet to hardfloor seamlessly, maneuvers like a dream, and has NO CORD! Talk about convenient and easy to use!  Of course, the most amazing part is how it cleans itself! After I'm all done vacuuming everything high and low, I just set it back into it's base and it sucks all of the cat hair and dirt right out of the vacuum and into a bag inside the base! How awesome is that?!? No dust, no mess, no fuss, to pulling out parts to shake over the garbage can! Also, all of the filters are hand washable. It comes with an extra filter, dust bags, all sorts of attachments, and easy to follow instructions and information!I LOVE LG! LG must stand for Life's Great, because every time I purchase a new product from them I am blown away with how well thought out it is, how great it works, and how much easier it has made my life (I love their clothes washers and dryers - they make me so happy, not to mention their smart tv).You need this vacuum!  You will be so happy that you chose it, trust me!</td>

I have 2 dogs, and the hair filled up my Dyson in 10 minutes. Then I would have to pull the dog hair out with my fingers. Ugh!! It was horrible. Now that I have the LG auto emptying vacuum, it is an absolute pleasure vacuuming my house. I never have to pull dog hair out to empty the vacuum again. What a game changer. Worth every penny!!!!

      <td>Amazing</td>
      <td>I love the LG cordless vacuum cleaner!  Assembly was super easy, each part came with easy to follow instructions.  It took my son and I about 10 mins to assemble completely.  I love how light weight the vacuum cleaner is!  I struggle with back problems and I had no problem adjusting the handle to fit my height.  I also love how the vacuum base swivels and fits under small spaces.  I was able to vacuum under my kitchen table and chairs without moving it.  Also, the vacuum did an amazing job reaching all the way under my bed (I have a bed that sits high off the floor).  Overall, this is the best vacuum I’ve owned!  The only downfall is price, I feel like it’s slightly over priced.  For the price of the vacuum I feel as if it should vacuum on its own…not me still pushing it.  It’s a plus that it does self empty but I still have to push it…lol.</td>

It clogs often, but Im thankful for the little lever you can push down to help. The attachments are nice and it works well in tight spots. I like the tower for storage however I don't like that the tower takes bags. I thought we were far away from bags. The suction is mediocre but works well on the high setting. I also like that it has multiple batteries. For the price? Not sure it's worth it.</td>

      <td>Extraordinary vacuum!</td>
      <td>The LG CordZero has immediately become my favorite vacuum! Set up was so simple for the tower, the vacuum itself, and the Wi-Fi/ThiQ app. First thing I did was get the batteries charging. Being able to charge the extra battery to have ready at all times is convenience at its finest! Next up was putting all the accessories in their place inside the tower. How wonderful to have a place for everything, right where you need it. I enjoy vacuuming so much more when it’s cordless. Cleaning can be a pain, having to drag a cord behind you, needing to switch plugs when you move onto a farther room! I am ecstatic to be cord free! I am able to go directly from the hardwood floors, to the tiled floors, and right to the carpet with ease. There’s no change in suction, no switch needing to be switched. It’s completely effortless. The battery life is superb. Two-story home, multiple bathrooms and bedrooms, a loft, kitchen, dining room, office, and a laundry room… all vacuumed with battery still remaining, 1/3rd to be exact. Let me tell you, you never knew you needed your vacuum to empty itself until you have this LG CordZero Vacuum!! I never would have thought that would be my favorite feature. It’s incredible! The pictures I have attached are from the first use, after vacuuming with my current vacuum the day before! This not only shows that the suction power of the Smart Inverter Motor can get what your current vacuum is leaving behind, but also how well the auto empty feature works! Just when you think this vacuum can’t get any better…  Power Mop attachment! Amazing! This one vacuum has been able to replace three cleaning tools (stick vacuum, dust buster, and mop) for me and I am so thankful!</td>

      <td>So far beyond my expectations!</td>
      <td>Wow! LG really hit it out the park with this vacuum! It does is all! Vacuums, mops, empties debris on it own! Set up was relatively easy, maybe 15-20 minutes, and it is only because everything comes so well packed. The mop features 2 dual spinning microfiber pads, which do all the hard work for you. My other mop is officially retired! I have never seen my kitchen floors so clean! The vacuum has a 5 step HEPA filtration system,  so you know you are getting a clean carpet with less allergens left behind. It comes with 2 batteries, it is recommended to switch them out after every use to extend the life of the batteries. Which makes sense and is very fast and simple to do. They say it goes about 2hr before needing a charge or needing to switch batteries.  But honestly, it only takes 20- 30 minutes to completely clean my floors. The housing tower is great! It's stylish but low-key so it does not stand out. It houses just about everything, it is great having everything in one spot! It empties the broom stick in seconds and is relatively a quite process. Over all it went way beyond my expectations! It has changed the way I cleaned and has made the actual cleaning process easier, taking a lot less time.</td>

It’s so nice that I don’t need to empty the canister when I’m done vacuuming. It does it for me when I dock the unit. I have not replaced the bag yet after 4 weeks of use so that’s another positive.

In particular, it is great on wood floors, gets along edges, in corners, and under furniture better than most vacuums.  Both the Power Mop and the Universal Nozzle work great.

      <td>Powerful Vacuum That Empties Itself</td>
      <td>I was very impressed with the functionality of this vacuum system. There are two parts, the cordless stick vacuum and the power base. The vacuum proved to be very powerful in cleaning about 1200 square feet of carpet on the turbo setting and still had plenty of charge left. This system came with two batteries. It is important to state one battery charges in the base power unit (to be ready when needed) and the other battery will also charge when the stick vacuum is docked on the base unit. Very smart design point. These 26 volt batteries provide a lot more suction power than the usual 14 to 18 volt systems; and proved long lasting as well.\nAfter vacuuming 1200 square feet I noticed that the dust bin on the stick vacuum had about 3 inches of hair and dust particles. I had just used another cordless stick vacuum the day before for the same area. So this test definitely showed the LG vacuum power was far superior. \nThe power base unit has its own vacuum setup to suck out the stick vac’s dustbin into a dust bag housed in the power base unit. I can confirm that the 3 inches of pet hair and dust was removed into the base unit (see my before and after photos). When I looked at the stick vac’s dust bin, not only was all the debris gone but it appeared the inside of the dust bin had been wiped clean – great system and a tip of the cap to the LG engineering team. You will notice that when the base unit cleans the stick vacuum dust bin, it actually opens the bottom plate on the dustbin and closes it again when the cycle is completed – I love that kind of engineering. The whole system has solid quality and is very well designed.\nThe system included a very complete set of accessories that included a small cleaning brush which was very handy for cleaning filters, a crevice tool, a combo brush and suction head that was great for cleaning car floors, a vacuum head with moving roller-brush for carpet, a mop head (2 spinning disc-shaped mops with liquid chamber) and a pet nozzle for furniture and other areas. Wow, a lot of uses covered. All these accessories store in the power base unit.\nIf all these features aren’t enough, the unit connects to your home’s WiFi system. Now using your cell-phone you can monitor activity of this vacuum system. I initially thought the WiFi control button was on the base unit, but it is on the stick vacuum and is labelled. The unit easily connected to the WiFi – you must use a 2.4 GHz access point.\nI did also run the included mop head to clean my kitchen and bathroom floors. Easy job but be sure to wash the mop heads by hand after each use. It’s easier to dry the mop heads in a dryer but don’t put the heads in a washing machine.\nThe technology used in this vacuum system is outstanding. I highly recommend this vacuum system.</td>

      <td>This one certainly sucks.... in a good way</td>
      <td>This vacuum is amazing with a lot of great features. When you first open the box, the vacuum and attachments are in three boxes. The initial set-up of the vacuum is fairly easy once you open everything. The base for the vacuum is very simple and modern. The vacuum sits nicely in the middle with auto charging, the sides are actually doors where you can store the attachments, the bag is on the inside of the base, and the extra battery charges on top. I love that I can store everything and not have to see it all. The package comes with the vacuum itself, the base, two batteries, a general vacuum attachment, pet hair attachment, mopping attachment, two smaller attachments, a spare battery, 4 microfiber mop clothes, two reusable filters, and two bags.In my apartment, I have rugs and laminate floors. I had no issues with using the general vacuum attachment to clean everything. The suction is great, but you are able to increase the suction to turbo. The turbo works great for hair or extra dirt, but it does drain the battery quite a bit more. I recently had a friend with a dog visit and was excited to test out the pet hair attachment. It’s significantly smaller so if you have a large space, it may take longer to clean. I think it did a great job getting all of the hair out of my rugs. If you have a pet that is a heavy shedder, this may not be for you but mild-moderate shedding would be fine. They have a soft attachment that I used for corners, baseboards, window sills and it was perfect for cleaning up some dust.I was very excited about the mopping attachment. I think it’s a wonderful feature with some limitations. Directions say to only use water, so you can’t use any floor cleaner. You are suppose to wet the pads before starting, which is definitely necessary! The mop attachment has a water reservoir and three levels to dispense water: no water, low water, or high water. It certainly dispenses a lot less than I expected. I’ve kept it on high water and by the time I clean my kitchen floors, I couldn’t even tell the water tank was empty. I think this is a great feature for just regular maintenance of floors, but if you need to really clean them, may need to use a regular mop. The microfiber clothes are soft on the floor and the vacuum does a great job rotating them while cleaning. Safe to use on my laminate floor.LG has produced a package of additional attachments to use with this vacuum, including a mattress attachment. I use the pet hair attachment on my mattress recently and worked fine! But it’s nice to know there are extra attachments to purchase.The biggest highlight of the system is the automatic dispensing. There’s nothing I hate more than emptying a vacuum and getting dust and hair everywhere. Once you bring the vacuum back to the base, it automatically charges and automatically cleans out the debris in the vacuum and dumps it into the bag. The system alerts you when the bag is ready to be changed. It does such a wonderful job at getting everything out of the vacuum! It is a bit loud when it does this, but it doesn’t take long.Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum! It’s sleek, lightweight, easy to use, and keeps everything clean. There’s always limitations to cordless vacuums, but overall this vacuum does an excellent job. I’m very satisfied and looking forward to cleaning with it!</td>

      <td>Honestly, I don’t know where to even start on why I love this vacuum because it really is amazing! I am quite the vacuum snob so I am not easily impressed lol. I have hardwood, tile floors, carpet and shag area rugs in my house and this vacuum works beautifully on all of them. Some of the things that stand out the most to me are how it effectively cleans and fluffs the shag area rugs without getting bogged down like my other stick vac. I think the diameter of the agitator helps since it is so large and the shag cannot wrap around it at all. The suction on the bare tile and hardwood it fantastic and I am super impressed but the suction and cleaning ability against baseboards. The docking station and self cleaning feature is fantastic. I love that you store all of the attachments in the base and that you have a backup battery ready to go! The battery life is much better than my other stick vacs I’ve had. I was able to do multiple rooms in a single charge. Also, this vac is very quiet compared to my others. A++ for this stick vac!</td>

      <td>Poor design : The ring that you push down to dump out of the container constantly gets garbage stuck above it. Causing it to clog and to not work at all. Happens 9/10 times using it. Just a very bad design. \n\nThe auto empty system is bagged NOT bag-less. Meaning you have to purchase additional bags to use the auto empty function. Never used this feature because of this.\n\nIf you have hard floors, good luck. Anything thicker than a hair will not be picked up. There is a microscopic opening in which things can actually be vacuumed up between the head and the floor. Non adjustable either.\n\nCarpet and rugs: just don’t even bother as soon as you turn it on it becomes bound up on a quantum level. you would have a better chance of picking up Thors hammer.</td>

      <td>LG Vacuum warranty service is terrible.</td>
      <td>Let me TLDR this real quick.  The vacuum is great, when it works... My base unit broke and this is the story of my warranty service....I bought this unit a month ago and not soon after I got it the base unit stopped working.  I called LG support and was transferred to India or the Philippines or whatever where a representative(who barely spoke english) made me run through a bunch of "troubleshooting" procedures ending with, "Now you have to unplug the unit, wait an hour and call us back"  As ridiculous as this was I did it, and sure enough called back the next day where once again I had to do all of the same troubleshooting again until I finally got fed up and told them either set up an exchange or I am going to return it to the retailer(Amazon).  The guy actually told me that's exactly what I should do(as in return it to the retailer).  Never heard of this in my life....  Anyways, since the vacuum was actually still working (just the base was broken) I asked why can't I get the base fixed?  So after another 30 minutes I was offered what is the only option for service on these.  You have to pack the ENTIRE thing back up(the box is HUGE), ship it back to them, wait up to two weeks for them to fix it and then they will send it back.  They said the whole process can take up to a month.... This is ridiculous, every large company these days will either send you a replacement right away and put a hold on your credit card so you send the old one back or they will at least let you ship it back and when they get it, send you a new one out again, but these guys want hold on to your broken one for a couple weeks while they try to fix it.... Ridiculous.  The vacuum is good when it works but I won't buy another until they change their warranty policy and stop farming out their customer service to people who don't understand you and vice versa.</td>

      <td>I have had my eye on this product since shortly after its introduction.  Previously, I had a separate electric mop and stick vac with accessories that were 'all over the place' and difficult to keep them organized.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I find the quality of the product very good.  I like the style factor, the power of the vacuum, and the ability to organize accessories centrally.  And yes, the extra battery is fantastic because my previous Dyson pooped out on, it seemed, 5 minutes before I could finish a chore.  Plus, the self-emptying feature is very convenient.  My feedback concerns the mop capability.  It simply needs to be stronger.  I would characterize this by what I see in the results and that this functionality simply takes too many passes to achieve expected results (vs. w/my separate electric mop as a comparison).  I will take on experimenting for more effectiveness, but regardless, I am happy to have this high quality, multi-functional device in my home.</td>

      <td>Underwhelming</td>
      <td>I bought this vacuum as an investment, I thought it would be a high quality, enjoyable and easy to use. However the suction is extremely weak and to even get to enough power it has to be at the most powerful turbo mode which only lasts for seven minutes on a four hour battery charge. If this is how weak it is now I hate to think how useless it will become once it starts to lose power. The features on this otherwise are both useful and well made so it having so little power is extremely disappointing. Plus the one tiny wheel is not large enough making using this vacuum extremely hard to move on carpet most vacuums pull away from you and are able to pull in dirt surrounding the outside of the tool but this is unable to do either. Finally the feature that allows you to adjust the height is very nice in thought but due to the fact that it often unlocks during use making it shrink and grow with movement makes it irritating and overall more difficult to use. I was extremely disappointed by all of this as I’m usually a fan of lg products as my fridge, washer, dryer, stove, etc. are all lg products. I hope lg is able to improve on this product and bring it to match the higher standard of its other products.</td>

      <td>Expensive but with value - little update</td>
      <td>We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot. Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning. Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking. Went to the new Shark, nice but loud. Worked well, a bit heavy. Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out. After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional. Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too. Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it. It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time. It is very lightweight, surprisingly so. The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus. No switch to push between carpet and flooring. The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway. That actually straightens out the fringe. Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight. So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough. Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag. Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories. Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops. Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand. Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are. Yep, really big complaints there. We believe this was well worth the cost.Little update concerning fringe. Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides. Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming. Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened. The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing. Gee, impressed even more.</td>

      <td>Aesthetically it has all features to get good hold of this stick vacuum cleaner. Its very light in weight and very easy to maneuver. This stick has inbuilt feature to adjust the height which is pretty cool. Its much quieter than traditional heavy duty vacuum cleaner but little nosier than its competitor. \r\nVacuum cleaner is highly efficient in cleaning the floor. Highly effective on every thickness of the carpet. If small carpets roll in the vacuum cleaner, just stop the vacuums cleaner and it easily comes off.  It works just fine. Smooth in operation. Mop feature is also highly effective. Battery life is pretty good. It comes with spare battery so no issue of running out of juice. Really impressed with its aesthetic.\r\nTower is designed just to the perfection. Its compact in nature. Looks good. It can accommodate attachments which was impressive. (which helps a lot in our case) Emptying the vacuum cleaner in auto mode is absolutely easy, just hang it up and it will job for you. No mess at all. This tower can charge both batteries at a time including one installed in the cleaner. \r\nThis is impressive setup and clean way to use the vacuum. Highly recommended.</td>

      <td>All-In-One Vacuum, storage, charge, and mop</td>
      <td>During the last decade and companies are working on designing vacuums that are lightweight, cordless, easy to navigate, and emptying canisters. Usually, we have several options out there in the market to choose from but none of them truly offers what I exactly need. besides to aforementioned specs, self-emptying is becoming a demand. Personally, I would prefer to buy vacuums with such a feature only because of time constraints that lead me to invest in robot vacuums even though they are not as powerful as the regular human-operated ones. I believe and after my experience with this LG CordZero, I found that this LG provides me with a lot of conveniences; it is an all-in-one vacuuming solution, lightweight, and truly cordless since the tower serves as a storage, charger, and self-emptying whenever the vacuum is docked. it has powerful suction and looks modern and stylish. \n\nThe LG tower has two doors that serve as storage areas to store different attachments in each door compartment. In addition, The tower top is accessible it has a lid that can open up, and inside that small compartment, there is a charging station as well as a storage area for the second battery located underneath the top lid of the tower. This means there is always a spare charged battery that is always ready to use if needed. This top lid is a touch display where all touch control buttons are located such as auto mode, battery life, and dust emptying. Auto mode activates the self-emptying every time the vacuum sits back on the tower. By turning off the auto mode, self-emptying can be activated manually. The middle area when both doors are open is the house of the dust bag. I like the vacuum telescopic wand, it is adjustable and sturdy and easy to use and maneuver to reach low and high places but it does not have headlights which is a drawback to me. \n\nThe power mop feature is my other drawback, according to the manual it is not allowed to use any cleaning solution except water also the pads can be hand-washed only. From my experience, such limitation tells me that the power mop feature is marginal and not meant to be a replacement for the regular powered mop. It is still a nice touch to have for quick mopping but it is that efficient. The bin kompressor is a smart feature that doubles the storage of the tank which is a nice perk and I like it. It has a sliding handle that pushes and compacts debris to have more room for a longer vacuuming run. But what stands out about this stick vacuum is the self-emptying feature, it is convenient and provides a month of peace of mind and hassle-free bin emptying as well as the spare charged battery, and of course, the tower design in which all the attachments are stored, organized, and accessible.   \n\nWhat is included in this all-in-one vacuum: Stick vacuum, power brush nozzle, telescopic wand, power mini brush, Power mop nozzle, Base plate with 4 self-adhesive pads, 4 washable mop pads, 3 dust bags, 2 batteries, and water cup, cleaning brush, and a combination and crevice tool.</td>

      <td>If i could rate the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum with higher than 5 stars i would do so, gladly.\n\nFirst lets go over 2 terms that make this vacuum as incredible as it is.\n\nKOMPRESSOR technology means that the dirt and dust is compressed in the waste receptacle thus meaning you have to dump less while vacuuming.\n\nINVERTER technology means that the motor (which boasts a 10 year warranty by LG) operates at less than high speed without sacrificing suction power.\n\nImpressed yet? Stick around it only gets better. A lot of products boast rhat they are a complete system leaving out that for their system to be complete ya have to shell out some more cash.\n\nNot LG!!! Unboxing the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum i found out quickly that this is an All in One system and came with everything needed to handle your vacuuming duties. Unboxing i said to myself, ahh ok but i'll bet it doesnt include XY or Z. It did, right down to extra waste bags.\n\nThe hard surface polisher / cleaner was most impressive with its stainless steel cleaning heads to the high quality housing. This isnt some entry level item but a real deal built to last tool.\n\nSpeaking of accessories the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum comes with all the usual suspects (attachments), of course all high quality.\n\nNow for the best part. We have all bought vacuumes that have a plethora of attachments that ya have to wonder, where the heck ro i store all of this. Honestly as in my case with the exception of 1 or 2 i wind up misplacing them.\n\nThis is why this is unique LG has built in storage foe eveything so it all stays in the base unit and is hidden from view. So Cool!!!\n\nThe LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum is light as a feather but a powerhouse for cleaning. It jandles pet hair and allergens with ease and with Kompressor tech the dirt is compressed for less stop and go time.\n\nThis baby comes with a second battery to give approximately just under 2 hours of cleaning time. Your time may vary. The wand extends so even a 12 year old can vacuum. Ha! Good luck with that though.\n\nThe base is a charger for both batteries, holder for accessories and auto recepticle for your debris. This elimintes the spillage of manually dumping the dirt.  Lets be honest, this thing is powerful and attractive. The app tells ya when its time to change bags and can order for you, if you like.\n\nI cant say enough about this unit and I am sure you will agree too.\n\n\nCheers!</td>

All the attachments have a storage spot inside the two doors that open on either side of the main base station. Together this has everything you would need for keeping things clean.\n\nAlso has two rechargeable batteries with the following usage times.  Normal: 120min, Power: 60min, Turbo: 14min. Normal: 80min, Power: 40min, Turbo: 12min.  The batteries charge in the base/charging tower which is highly convenient.  One stays on the stick vacuum to charge and the other goes into the top compartment for charging.  \n\nOnto the real world usage that I've done.  First I did not download the LG ThinQ app that is supposed to tell you things like cleaning patterns and errors ect.  Second the batteries come drained which will require charging before use.  I let them charge overnight.  Also, I have not used the power mop yet as of this review.  But plan too soon.  Its a vacuum first IMO.\n\nI have a German Shepherd and if you know the breed, well they shed like crazy. So a good vacuum with lots of power is a necessity.  When first turning the stick vacuum on its in Normal mode. I could tell immediately that it wasn't going to be powerful enough for the job ahead. I quickly placed the vacuum on Turbo mode and it worked a lot better.  Still not perfect, but better than the default normal setting.  After 5 minutes of vacuuming I got a clog, the vacuum errored out and turned off.  I had to remove the attachments and pull out the hair from the top of the wand where it connects to the main unit, next to the canister. It appeared as though there was something large blocking the airway. Nope just dog hair.  After clearing the clog I went back to vacuuming and never had a clogging issue again (two days straight now).  Even the auto empty feature of the base would not unclogged the vacuum, just so you know.  But, as long as everything is in the canister then the auto emptying feature works very well.  You have to get the stick vacuum just right in the base for the Auto empty feature to work. Took me a couple times to get it right.\n\nI did use this vacuum without the Power Nozzle for some spot cleaning and that worked ok.  It was just more dog hair along the edges of the rooms and the corners. Nothing big like spilt cereal or other food items. I feel it might struggle.\n\nI feel the price for what you get, is a little high.  It just doesn't seem to have the power of my full size vacuum. And maybe it wasn't meant to replace that. But for the price you would think it would.  I will continue to use it full time though before I make up my mind fully.  Maybe if I didn't have a dog that sheds so much this would be a better fit.\n\nI think for apartment dwellers and people without dogs (or at least shedding dogs) this would be a better fit.  Its hard to recommend this vacuum.  Another last minute note.  The vacuum bags are 19.00 a piece and according to the LG website the bags will hold 3 Kompressed loads of dirt before needing replaced. That's going to get expensive if you ask me.  I bet I find myself emptying the bags and re-using them. If that's even a possibility.</td>

      <td>I got this stick vacuum in hopes of doing a better job keeping my carpeted stairs clean.  I was also excited that it might get used on the carpets in my vehicle.  What I was NOT expecting was:\r\n- A truly long battery life\r\n- A lightweight vacuum that I could easily carry all around my home\r\n- An enjoyable vacuuming experience\r\nOur home is 2500 square feet.  I used this first on my carpeted stairs, next I tackled the first floor, then I redid the stairs (with an attachment this time), and then last I did the entire second floor.  I depleted the first battery after about 35 minutes of use (much of that use was on Power Mode) and then I only used the second battery for a couple of minutes (showed 99% full battery when I finished) I used the Normal mode on my hard floors and the Power mode on my carpeted areas.\r\n\r\nI found it to be very easy and intuitive to set up and use the base station. I love that the included attachments are neatly stored (cannot say the same for my corded vacuum's attachments which can rarely even be found let alone used)  It's a real treat to have this in my home and I actually enjoy using it.  It's not giving me shoulder pain or a weird callus on my hand from using it for so long (I'm not the only one right?).... it's just light, easy, and powerful.  You'll feel like you're supposed to be hunched over and holding a cord out of the way.  It will take some getting used to, to not instinctively hunch over, and just be able to walk around comfortably, like you're not doing a labor-intensive chore.</td>

No need to hide it in a closet.\r\n\r\nThere is only one feature that my old stick vacuum had that this one doesn't that would be nice to have and that is a light on the vacuum so it shines along the floor as I'm vacuuming. Having that light does a great job of highlighting where little random bits have gotten off to. Other than that this vacuum has me sold. It might be a little pricey, but it is built to last.</td>

      <td>I received the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum with high expectations, and after using it for about a week, I was meh about it. \n\nIt comes loaded to the 9s with attachments and spare parts, like washable and reusable filters, a spare battery. What I was not expecting was a mop attachment to clean up small spills.\n\nSet up was simple, just find the parts and build the vacuum like a very expensive Lego set. The canister stand is pretty straight forward, just plug it in to the outlet. It does open up like an armoire revealing compartments for the attachments, you're most likely to use often. The top of the stand flips up, revealing a spot to charge the spare battery. Even the waste bin and filter were already installed and ready to go. With the auto empty feature or it being turned on at all, does lock the vacuum in to the dock so it can't be removed while emptying. It even plays a little song while doing so. \n\nThere is an app that I was told to use while reviewing the CordZero, but it was absolutely useless as it doesn't do much for the function of the vacuum. The most I believe you would use it for would be to reorder replacement filters or something. I wasn't able to register it for warranty as I didn't actually purchase this unit, so there's that unless I didn't something wrong on my end.\n\nIn use it's an extremely capable vacuum, it cleans really deep in turbo mode, pretty lightweight and emptying it is super convenient with the Auto Empty feature but can be emptied as any other $90 canister stick vacuum would be able to by just dumping the canister into the trash.</td>

      <td>Great...but not with pets</td>
      <td>This vacuum is really a very good product. It is light, does a good job on carpet and hard surfaces, and the auto-clean of the container is a nice feature. However, we have a Labrador retriever, and this product unfortunately continually clogs on her fur. Running the vacuum on max "turbo" helps reduce the clogging to a more manageable level - but you still have to periodically reach into the inlet and "hook" the fur out to unclog the device.The auto-clean feature also has trouble with pet fur. It either cannot remove it from the canister, or worse, it removes it from the canister but leaves it in the opening to the collection bag so it all falls on the floor when you remove the vacuum from the stand. We have even found the canister lid left open after the clean cycle because all the fur didn't get out - and the remaining contents all fell on the floor.We like the vacuum enough to keep experimenting with it - it's just somewhat disappointing that it handles pet fur so poorly. Rated it three stars because it is a good device, minus pet fur.</td>

      <td>Love this LG CordZero Vaccuum!</td>
      <td>I have recently gotten the LG Electronics CordZero Vaccuum and love so many things about this handy device! The vacuum came with so many assorted attachments including one for pet hair and a mopping attachment. It also came with an extra battery which I love!  The run time on one battery is a little over an hour if I keep it in auto mode and don't switch to Turbo. I love having that extra battery on hand and charged up the Tower when I need it. One unique feature about the CordZero is that it's handy base recharges it, stores the extra parts, battery and attachments as well as has an Auto Empty feature for cleaning out the debris from the vacuum dust bin! I love that is takes one more clean up step out of my normal routine! The tower is makes keeping all of the extra things that can be used with the vacuum so nice and tidy and in one spot for easy access. The vacuum is lightweight and the main attachment is easy to get around and under furniture. I like that the main attachment head is a bit smaller than some of the others I've seen as it can really get into tight spaces and under chairs. I love that when I turn it on, I don't have to keep holding down on a button to keep the suction going as I've had to do on vacuums I've had in the past. It does seamlessly from my hardwood to my tile to my carpet rugs and has a great Turbo mode that can be turned on for those places I worry have extra hard to reach dirt. The CordZero even has ap app that you can connect to that will show you run times. extra info on the troubleshooting and battery life. I think one of the super exciting things about the CordZero is that it has a mop attachment. Although this feature didn't live up to my expectations, I'll thrilled of the idea of a vacuum/mop combo!  The mop attachment has a place to put in water and it has little round pads that velcro on to the vacuum and spin around once you start it up. You can control the amount of water that comes out (it has a low to high setting) but the problem  I had was that I didn't think it really "mopped" my floor. There was moisture but it can't be used with soap or cleaner of any kind and I just don't feel like my floor are properly "mopped " with just a slight layer of water. I used the microfiber mop heads for about 15 minutes on my tile while I was trying out the mopping feature and once done, the mop heads were already frazzled and looked to be coming undone. I love the IDEA of the mop combo, but in my ideal world, it would have been able to be used with a cleaner to really get it good and clean and I would have more function in the amount of water that comes out ( I couldn't tell much difference in the low or high adjustments on the mop attachment). Also, the suction is turned off when you use the mop attachment and I would love to see a function added to be able to use the mop with water and cleaner and then have it sucked back up or go back over the water with a drying function. Again, I love the idea, but feel like the mop attachment could have some improvement to make it a 5 star product. I do like that the mop attachment has a little blue light that shines to help show you where the water is on the floor. Overall, I am thrilled with the uniqueness and creativity that this LG CordZero Vacuum brings to my home. The tower with it's multitude of functions is a real game changer in my book!</td>

      <td>The best vacuum I have ever owned.</td>
      <td>While this is pretty pricey I have to say that it is well worth it. Overall this is the best cordless vacuum that I have ever owned and here are the reasons why.\r\n\r\n1. The vacuum is much lighter compared to other cordless vacuums that I have owned. My previous vacuum seemed like a workout when I vacuumed the whole house. Whereas this one is a breeze.\r\n2. Battery life. This vacuum does a great job keeping my 2200 square foot home clean and hasn't run out of power yet and if it does I am not worried because there is a spare always charging in the vacuum base.\r\n3. The suction. Boy does this vacuum suck but in a good way. On the highest setting it is pulling up the dirt stuck UNDER my carpet which I have never had a vacuum do.\r\n4. The base. I like that this vacuum has a base where you plug it into. Not only does it make the kids put it up instead of leaving it wherever like they did with the old vacuum but it also provides a convenient storage location for all of the vacuum accessories.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the one thing that I do not like about this vacuum.\r\n1. It doesn't have a light. This is kind of disappointing but overall this is still the best vacuum I have ever owned.</td>

      <td>The perfect vacuum!</td>
      <td>I've been very impressed with this vacuum so far. Took a bit to set it all up but once you're done you have an all-in-one tower/charge station that contains everything you need. All the attachments are stored inside the tower - no clutter at all! The actual vacuum is sleek and lightweight, and the lack of a cord offers so much freedom. It transitions easily between carpet and hardwood floors, and suction is strong even without going into the highest setting. It comes with an extra battery that sits in the tower until you need it, but I haven't had to use it yet! The main perk of this vacuum is the auto-emptying feature; once you've finished vacuuming you just place it back into the charge station and it'll empty itself into a bag installed inside. You can set this to automatic or manual with just a press of a button (and if you're wondering if you can still manually empty it, you can!) There's also an app you can use, and while it's not required to use the vacuum it's very useful to have as it greatly helps with maintenance. I'd recommend it even if you're not a big fan of constant apps like I am. Overall I'd say it's exceeded my expectations. It's plenty strong and the convenience of going cordless is just too good. You'll definitely love cleaning with this vacuum!</td>

      <td>Good not Great and Expensive Cordless Vacuum / Mop</td>
      <td>With my review of this LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty and Kompressor, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.  Upon opening the three boxes, I located the instruction manuals.  Be prepared to dedicate some time to learn how to operate this product because it is not a function of plug and play!  It does take some time to put together, time to learn how to use, and finally, how to maintain.  The entire product takes up some floor real estate, measuring 40" high, 14" deep, and 18" wide with depth and width measurements made with the two doors in the open position.\n\nAs for using the vacuum, I cleaned my entire home using the Universal Nozzle, covering luxury vinyl tile and carpet for a total run time of 29-minutes in Normal Mode to a fully exhausted battery.  Luckily there are two batteries with this product with the second battery in the charging station.  I have attached two pictures showing the amount of debris before and after using the Kompressor Lever.  As you can see from the debris, I have two cats that shed a LOT.  I then connected the vacuum back into the charging station and selected the Empty Dust mode.  I have attached a picture showing empty canister along with a picture of the Dust Bag, being approximately 3/4 full.\n\nAs for using the Mop Nozzle, you can only fill the mop reservoir with plain tap water with no cleaning agents at all.  There is a supplied water funnel that fills the reservoir with 200ml of water.  The Mop Nozzle is not intended to clean spills and only having the use of only water in the reservoir, I questioned how can this effectively clean floors.  For a test, I cleaned half my kitchen floor and much to my dismay, it didn’t look clean.  Perhaps my floor was too dirty so I found myself spraying a fine mist of tile floor cleaner and then going over with the Mop Nozzle.  If you had to clean a large area, I believe you would have to manually wash the mop heads, to avoid just spreading dirt around.\n\nSo in review of the price of $999 versus performance, I find this product not a great buy, hence 3 out of 5 star rating.  Here are some of the shortcomings I find in the design and function.  The vacuum Universal Nozzle does not have a lighted head making for cleaning in dark area or under beds cumbersome.  The size of the Dust Bag leads me to question its longevity before replacement as having mine ¾ filled with one use.  There isn’t a hard floor attachment for the vacuum and would not use the supplied beater-brush heads to clean delicate laminate flooring.  As for the Mop Nozzle, I find this for general light cleaning only along with the inability to use only water in the reservoir.  Finally as for attachments, there is the mention of some very useful attachments that such as Slim Hard Floor Nozzle, Flexible Hose Extension and its Crevice Tool, and Mattress Tool, as part of their Total Care Kit but they are free only if purchased directly through LG.com.  I hope you enjoyed my review of this product and it helps you in your purchase decision.</td>

      <td>I wanted to love this system. First of all, It took a while to unbox and set up this unit. The base's sides open to component storage. The top holds a battery charger for the 2nd battery. It's all quite compact and lovely when set up. I was surprised at the size of the capture bag in the base. It's smaller than I expected, but this about the dirt/debris being compacted into this bag so I imagine that it will take quite some time to fill it up.\n\nNow, lets move on to the vaccuum itself I was excited to use it. I turned it on and gave it a push across the carpet that I vaccuumed and shampooed four days ago. I've had some powerful suction vaccuums including a pretty good cordless stick vac. This wasn't as powerful as I was expecting. I clicked the + to boost power, it was better but still not as great as I was expecting. I ran it for about 8 minutes and it started sounding weird, power going up and down and it shut off then beeped. There was a red light on the front flashing. It indicated a clog. I took the motor off the pole and saw a clog, pet hair, at the top of the neck. I tried and tried to get it out, even used a chopstick to pull out the clog. I could only pull out so much so I started pushing the rest to move down to the dirt canister. There's a lever to push down the dirt. It seemed like a really cool idea. However once this clog cleared the neck it is now stuck above that lever. I let it run and run to try to get it free, but no such luck. Maybe eventually it will clear. \n\nI then tried the mop feature. The instructions said to use water, no cleaning solution. I didn't get the clean I was hoping for and had to hand wash the mop heads had to be done before I was half done with my kitchen was actually rather disappointing. \n\nFor the price, $999 I was expecting so much more from this system. It will be passable for light cleaning but if you have pets, or have deeper cleaning needs, I can't recommend.</td>

      <td>Excellent All-in-One Solution for Vacuuming</td>
      <td>The LG CordZero All-In-One vacuum with storage tower is an excellent representation of what vacuums should become for the home user. This LG creation breaks away from the land of stick vacuum clones by offering a system not found anywhere else. An all-in-one, self-contained self-emptying charging station hides the messy side of vacuuming. This cleaning system competes in the elite top tier of vacuums against the granddaddy cyclone vacuum and other primetime names in cordless stick vacuums space. The beautifully designed stand/tower creates a place for everything, so attachments are neatly placed and visible in a stand that automatically charges and cleans the vacuum. Hence, it is ready when you need it to be. No more looking for attachments or where you left the spare battery. It is all in one tower for you. There is just a simple and well-thought-out execution missing from other brands.\n \nUnboxing and Setup\nEverything was well packed and secure - straightforward and intuitive to set up. Remove everything from the box, and you will see how everything fits together once you put the stand on the floor. I want to mention that it was a pretty heavy box at around 50lbs - for some, this may be a team lift, so plan accordingly. Once you place your stand, but all the accessories inside the tower and admire your work. Everything looks so lovely in that corner now, doesn't it!?!? This has smart connectivity, but I chose not to use it after it only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we still only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?\n \nPerformance and Differentiators\nThe most wonderful feature here on this vacuum is the simple use of an on/off switch. No more holding a trigger - press once, and you are good to go until you are finished. The inclusion of the electric mop is nice and offers added value and cleaning power for your arsenal. LG is changing the game here rather than copying the granddaddy of vacuums. The telescoping wand allows reconfiguration to compensate for differences in cleaning areas and user heights. The spare battery lives in a charging station just under the lid that you can quickly remove if necessary. The electric mop offers a floor scrubbing solution but isn't complete because it can't vacuum up like a dedicated electric mop to leave your floor streak-free. This is meant to be an agitator and doesn't suck up dirty water from the floor. Think a Swiffer with motorized scrubbers and then an air-dry with what's left on the surface.\n \nBuild Quality and Battery Life\nThe LG CordlessZero has just an okay build, almost entirely plastic build with beautiful minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing stand that will blend into any decor. I worry for those who drop their vacuum a lot of bang into things with all the plastic here. The attachments are all plastic, with the electric mop having metal. Now let's talk battery life here. I tested on the carpet with carpet head. I got about 35 mins on MEDIUM (+) power (probably could go a bit longer, but I finished. When set on TURBO and you get maybe 10 mins, and on NORMAL you get around an hour. I have never run out of battery yet during a cleaning session taking care of 3 levels with stairs and carpets in my 2500 sq ft place. Here are the specs straight from LG's website pertaining to the battery life for Normal (handy): 120min, Power (handy): 60min, Turbo (handy): 14min. With floor wand Normal (Stick): 80min, Power (Stick): 40min, Turbo (Stick): 12min.\n \nHere is a quick list of my things that make this vacuum excellent and some things I wish were thought through again. Hopefully, these things can be addressed in future renditions.  \n \nLove\n-On/Off switch - no more trigger pulling for long sessions.\n-Portable power - it's great for auto cleaning and quick cleanups. I take it to the office to touch up the desk and take it home.\n-Lightweight in the hand - you can clean for a while as fatigue is reduced due to design and weight.\n-Kompressor button - being able to touch the stuff in the canister without touching it is nice.\n-Tower Stand - completely self-contained in a minimalist stand. No need to wall mount a charger.\n-2 Batteries - two batteries provided with one stored and charged so it is always ready for a swap.\n-Quieter - it is quiet, but the performance suffers as well. Run this on medium for better cleaning, and it still is quiet compared to other vacuums I tried.\n-3 step HEPA filtration - clean, breathable air for those with allergies and who don't like to empty the bin.\n \nC'mon Man!\n-2.4GHz WiFi Networks ONLY! - only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?\n-Power button placement - Often, you can press it by just walking around with it or placing it on the dock.\n-Maintenance - with all the features, there is maintenance. You need to maintain filters in the tower, the self-emptying part, and the hand unit.\n-Deep cleaning performance - things sometimes don't get sucked up in one pass with minimal improvement in TURBO mode. Larger cereal isn't easily vacuumed.\n-TURBO mode activation - it takes FOREVER to activate. It feels longer than 3 seconds but sheesh!\n-No AUTO suction mode - highly disappointing to a vacuum in this range\n-No on-wand clip for attachments\n-Battery indicator - no timer useful with remaining battery life. Old style 3 bar battery for you to guess from. Minutes left would be more valuable as the rest of the pack provides these days.\n-Tiny Dust bin capacity - 300ml, which is 40% smaller than competitors\n-Non-removable bin - You cannot separate the container from the handle to clean like competitors\n-Exhaust position - while using, you will get exhaust in your face. Use this on your stairs or anywhere you have the vacuum below your face and enjoy a blast of hot air. I slightly angle the handle, and it helps a little.\n-Plasticky build - everything from the tube to the vacuum itself and its accessories are plastic! I hope you aren't rough and bang into furniture or walls. After a few drops with the wand attached, I don't see this lasting.  \n-Battery life - isn't that great compared to others in the market, but you get two, so it is not as bad.  \n-Roller drags - compared to other vacuums used on carpet, the head has a significant drag and pressure when going through medium shag rugs. It often "digs" into the carpet, and you have to push to regain control.\n-Loud in Turbo mode - like REALLY loud!</td>

      <td>Love Love Love this...the self-cleaning is best. I typically just remove the dirt from the internal throw away bags to save money, but honestly, I may not do that every time. It's lightweight, goes under the furniture well. GREAT suction. Once the tank gets full, I self-clean and back to work I go. I wish I had gotten the extra insurance, just in case, because it is a big investment. So far, LG has NOT disappointed in washing machines. So I feel confident; however, get the extra insurnace on any expensive appliances. Love the compact housing unit. Love how it hangs up well and easily. Love the back up battery and love that it charges while in the unit. Have not tried the water cleaning yet, but will soon and let you know.</td>

      <td>Upscale vacuum perfect for larger home</td>
      <td>LG has put a lot of thought into this vacuum. The auto-empty and compacting features allow us to clean on more occasions without having to constantly empty the vacuum. I have indoor/outdoor allergies so I very much appreciate the lack of need to constantly inhale dust while emptying the unit as that spreads debris and dust back into the home, which I usually try to avoid as much as possible. The unit is on the larger side, but it is powerful and sleek, and given that you can get multiple cleanings and have the unit automatically emptied takes several steps out of my cleaning routine which, as a busy household I welcome. The unit is also very easy to turn on with touch controls and the 2 batteries that provide a 2 hour charge make it easy to take the vacuum to both floors of the home and have enough time to clean both floors. This vacuum makes it way more sanitary for us to clean our home, as it contains the dirty much better than others we've owned before. Inadvertently those units always spill dirt while emptying the cannister and that adds another time consuming sweep. Love this upgraded, thoughtful and upscale vacuum. Not just functional, but also very thoughtful and beautiful in my home cleaning space.</td>

      <td>The suction isn’t too good. All the previous vacuums I’ve owned have bristles that pick up from the sides. This one just pushes small debris out and takes several passes. Not very convenient as it requires multiple changes of attachments rather than one to do the job. I’ve had robo vacuums that do a better job than this one. The filter clogs up quick. Seems to require filter wash with every use. Not very convenient again. I bought this expensive $1200 vacuum because of not having to empty the canister but the clogged filter with each use and the smell because the unit is towards ur face at top of handle when vacuuming makes the job unpleasant. Over all waste of money. It doesn’t do a great job of its function: vacuum</td>

      <td>Brand New Unit Came Broken</td>
      <td>I was very happy and excited to open this new product. The concept of this vacuum was different, which had me switch over to LG (coming from owning several Dyson vacuums and other Dyson products). After watching many reviews on this vacuum and seeing other people un-boxing videos. I had high hopes for this product. However, the extension pipe arrived with a dent mark. Another worst thing, the main unit was not sucking up any of the dirt! The dirt bin was completely brand new, even after vacuuming the whole basement. The vacuum powers on (for certain attachments) and off, WI-FI worked and connected to device. The power mode did not work at all. The speed of the vacuum was the same, even when trying to switch it to turbo mode. It's like it has only one mode. The lowest mode possible. With the standard attachment, the brush would spin like normal and managed to pick up some debris from the carpet. As soon as I lift the vacuum up, all the debris fell back on the carpet. When I place my hand near the attachment, I can feel the air flow coming out. I tried all the little attachments, couldn't even get the power to turn on. Both batteries were fully charged. \r\n\r\nI reached out to LG support and the representative suggested to ship the main unit back to them for repairs and diagnostic but it'll take 3-5 days to get the shipping box. Plus an additional 7 days for them to do the repairs. The extension pipe is in for replacement. Honestly, for a product that is this pricey. I'm very disappointed. A vacuum that doesn't even vacuum.... I had zero issue with my other vacuums. You buy a product brand new hoping everything will work properly on the first try. \r\n\r\nJust a very bad experience. Will update the review once the unit is repaired. But so far, I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I can't tell you to skip the hassle and go with another brand. At this moment, that's what I'm leaning towards. But I will give it another try once it's fixed.</td>

      <td>This certainly doesn’t suck</td>
      <td>This vacuum is amazing with a lot of great features. When you first open the box, the vacuum and attachments are in three boxes. The initial set-up of the vacuum is fairly easy once you open everything. The base for the vacuum is very simple and modern. The vacuum sits nicely in the middle with auto charging, the sides are actually doors where you can store the attachments, the bag is on the inside of the base, and the extra battery charges on top. I love that I can store everything and not have to see it all. The package comes with the vacuum itself, the base, two batteries, a general vacuum attachment, pet hair attachment, mopping attachment, two smaller attachments, a spare battery, 4 microfiber mop clothes, two reusable filters, and two bags.\n\nIn my apartment, I have rugs and laminate floors. I had no issues with using the general vacuum attachment to clean everything. The suction is great, but you are able to increase the suction to turbo. The turbo works great for hair or extra dirt, but it does drain the battery quite a bit more. I recently had a friend with a dog visit and was excited to test out the pet hair attachment. It’s significantly smaller so if you have a large space, it may take longer to clean. I think it did a great job getting all of the hair out of my rugs. If you have a pet that is a heavy shedder, this may not be for you but mild-moderate shedding would be fine. They have a soft attachment that I used for corners, baseboards, window sills and it was perfect for cleaning up some dust.  \n\nI was very excited about the mopping attachment. I think it’s a wonderful feature with some limitations. Directions say to only use water, so you can’t use any floor cleaner. You are suppose to wet the pads before starting, which is definitely necessary! The mop attachment has a water reservoir and three levels to dispense water: no water, low water, or high water. It certainly dispenses a lot less than I expected. I’ve kept it on high water and by the time I clean my kitchen floors, I couldn’t even tell the water tank was empty. I think this is a great feature for just regular maintenance of floors, but if you need to really clean them, may need to use a regular mop. The microfiber clothes are soft on the floor and the vacuum does a great job rotating them while cleaning. Safe to use on my laminate floor.\n\nLG has produced a package of additional attachments to use with this vacuum, including a mattress attachment. I use the pet hair attachment on my mattress recently and worked fine! But it’s nice to know there are extra attachments to purchase. \n\nThe biggest highlight of the system is the automatic dispensing. There’s nothing I hate more than emptying a vacuum and getting dust and hair everywhere. Once you bring the vacuum back to the base, it automatically charges and automatically cleans out the debris in the vacuum and dumps it into the bag. The system alerts you when the bag is ready to be changed. It does such a wonderful job at getting everything out of the vacuum! It is a bit loud when it does this, but it doesn’t take long. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this vacuum! It’s sleek, lightweight, easy to use, and keeps everything clean. There’s always limitations to cordless vacuums, but overall this vacuum does an excellent job. I’m very satisfied and looking forward to cleaning with it!!</td>

      <td>This is my first wireless vacuum after a life of corded uprights. I can't believe how great it is - if I see dirt or a ball of dust - just grab the vacuum off the rechargeable stand, vacuum it up and return it. No more unwinding the cord, vacuuming, then winding it back up. Also - if you are used to a corded vacuum like me - this one is so light! Vacuuming stairs has never been easier (or safer in my opinion). It has a spare battery if you have a lot of cleaning to do. I have not needed it yet. The suction on it is great and it is very easy to steer around corners. A great vacuum indeed!</td>
