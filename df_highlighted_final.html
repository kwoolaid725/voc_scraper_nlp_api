      <td>LG – Try Harder…</td>
      <td>SHORT REVIEW: The LG - CordZero A931KWM All-in-One (AIO) has four enhanced features, versus our current LG A916BM that both my wife and I have been using over the past year, and we both are very satisfied with its performance.  The A931 enhanced features include: Auto-Empty, Kompressor Technology, AOI Storage Tower, along with the Lighted Dual Floor Max Nozzle.  \n\nAll in all, a premium priced, better than average “stick vacuum” system that could meet the requirements of a small single floor home.  And especially useful for spot cleaning at the higher power settings.  Larger two- or three-story homes would be better served with LG’s CordZero vacuums that include dual batteries and AIO Towers that will store and charge a second battery.  \n\n\nIN-DEPTH REVIEW BY FEATURES: \n\nPACKAGING: Very well thought out with two separate parts boxes, plus a heavy Styrofoam base for the AIO Tower unit.  Doubtful any courier would be able to destroy or damage any of the components during shipment.  \n\nASSEMBLE: Really couldn’t be easier if you read and follow the User Quick and Maintenance Guides.  But honestly, if you have assembled any kind of vacuum, this is as simple as it gets and is very intuitive to put together.   \n\nCHARGING: The single included battery arrived without any substantial charge and required a good 3.5 hours on the AIO Tower unit.  Not a big deal and sort of expected. \n\nMAX NOZZLE: Ok, here is where the newly designed “Lighted Dual Floor Max Nozzle” earns its keep.  First, I really appreciate being able to actually see the floor illuminated from the LED array; a very functional feature.  Second, this dual function design powered head did a great job without major issues on our carpets, hardwoods, and tile flooring.   \n\nNote that any small throw rugs (example: bathroom rubber-based rugs) caused the power nozzle to drag the rugs around.  This required stopping the vacuum, releasing the rug from the nozzle, and then restarting.  In all fairness, all of our other vacuums would do the same thing.    \n\nEXTENDABLE WAND: A great concept with flawless execution, no need to store a second extension wand.  Just release the lever (Length Adjustment Button), pull, and extend.  Very sweet indeed. \n\nPOWER ON DEMAND: First, being able to keep a vacuum running, without needing to hold down a power/trigger button, is paramount to overall functionality.  Second, this unit not only has a low power base setting, but two additional higher power setting that will increase suction at the expense of greatly reduced battery life (actual run time).   \n\nKOMPRESSOR: The inclusion of the “Kompressor” components is a welcomed addition that our current A916 is missing.  If you own and clean a large home, the ability to compress the debris during vacuuming cuts down on the time one would stop to dump a supposedly filled canister.  Quite the time saver.  It is also extremely useful if you intend to manually dump and dispose of the canister debris. \n\nAIO TOWER:  The A931 All-in-One (AIO) Town is fairly inclusive for not only storing the supplied accessories, but also additional accessories if you choose to purchase them.  Or, happen to have them on-hand from previous LG A-Series vacuums.  Lots of places to hang accessories inside and outside the tower.  But it will not store an auxiliary battery.  Overall, a very pleasing looking vacuum tower with its stately off-white appearance.  \n\nAUTO-EMPTY: I have conflicting opinions on the Auto-Empty feature.  Initial thoughts were, this is such a great concept without needing to manually empty the power unit.  But after a few uses, realizing such a small volume vacuum bag, that holds approximately three full “Kompressed” cleanings, will be quite an expensive option.  If money is no object to you, go for it.  Because I am somewhat frugal, what I do is dump the large accumulation of compressed debris from the power unit outside in the trash.  Then let the Auto-Empty AIO Tower do its thing by initiating a manual self-clean for any remaining fine dust particles.   \n\nRecognize, using the Auto-Empty feature, you have at least four additional items/steps/cleanings that require direct user maintenance.  That’s in addition to the filters, parts, and areas that require cleaning on the power motor unit.  And let’s not forget the power nozzle maintenance.  \n\nBottom Line: There are numerous components that require removal, cleaning, washing, rinsing, drying for 24 hours, then reassembly.  I get it, high-tech precision devices require continual maintenance, there is no getting around it.  Just understand having an auto-empty feature adds additional steps, for maintaining peak performance, beyond simply tossing a filled vacuum bag in the trash.    \n\nMANUALS: Included with the unit are an assortment of hardcopy manuals.  In addition, there are PDF manuals that available for downloading, for future reference, when you misplace the hardcopy information.  There are numerous online video’s too.  \n\n  \nNEGATIVES: \n\nAIO TOWER: I believe LG should have included the ability to store and charge a second auxiliary battery, similar to their other AIO Towers, and a few of LG’s earlier non-AIO models.  I estimate one battery will provide sufficient power, on low, for up to a 1,000 Sq Ft home for a minor quick cleaning.  My home is much larger, and I don’t mind purchasing a second battery.  But without an easy method to store it and keep it charged, this model limits its overall usefulness for medium to large homes.  This deliberate omission can only be attributed to a small cost saving idea, that in reality transforms this AIO Tower system into a less than desirable purchase option.\n\nBATTERY LIFE: Like one of the other reviewers, I encountered what I considered very short battery life, about 14 minutes on low power and nowhere near the 60 minutes advertised.  And on medium power, I was only able to use for 7 minutes before it shut down.  Don’t know if it is attributed to the Max Nozzle with the array of LED’s drawing more power?  Maybe a bad or weak battery?  (And yes, I understand the advertised 60 minutes has a caveat of not using any powered nozzles.)  \n\nAfter speaking with a LG Customer Service Representative, LG offered a replacement battery that I would receive in 7 to 10 business days. \n \nVACUUM BAGS: The LG picture of the A931 tower replaceable vacuum bag has a small protruding sliding handle for what I would believe was “easy removal”.  The vacuum bag in this tower, along with the second spare bag, has apparently had a redesigned cardboard/fiber top plate and without the sliding handle.  And now there is nothing to get a good grip on for removal.  The major problem this created, I found it extremely difficult to remove the tower vacuum bag, it is very tightly held in place.  So much so, that I felt I was going to break the green plastic bag holder/release mechanism.  \n\nI ended up having to use pliers to grip the top plate and remove, and even then, it was like pulling teeth.  The replacement bag did the same thing, easy to insert, but requiring pliers and excessive force to remove. Not a good or acceptable situation, and one that should have been spotted and corrected by LG Quality Control prior to choosing to use a cheaper vacuum bag option.   \n\nAfter speaking with a LG Customer Service Representative, LG was unable to offer a working solution other than suppling a link to a YouTube video on how to replace the dust bag.  Ironically, the LG video shows the original bags with the levered sliding top plate.  Pliers not required for those…\n\nCLEANING BRUSH: Although there is no mention of a cleaning brush being included, it is shown hanging on the right side AIO panel in one of the LG stock photos.  And it is shown and referenced for “Cleaning the Kompressor System” in the suppled maintenance guide.  This correctly sized brush is required to be able to keep this unit in tip-top clean condition.  The brush can not cost more than one dollar, and is just another cost saving idea that I consider counterproductive by not including.  \n\n\nRATING: On paper and pictures, the LG - CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle A931KWM checks off a lot of boxes.  But in actual use, with the short battery life, the very poorly redesigned tower vacuum bags, the inability to store and charge a second battery, and not including a cleaning brush, each caused a lost one-half star.  Therefore, the A931KWM earned itself a 3-Star Rating, and I cannot recommend this unit to others.</td>

      <td>Not Just a Pretty Face</td>
      <td>Let's be honest - there's nothing attractive about cleaning.  If you want to start a fight with your partner, get them a vacuum for their birthday.  LG has done their part to make vacuuming floors about as attractive as possible.  But not only is it a pretty face, it also works really well.\n\nAt first glance the entire package looks very modern with a sleek and clean design.  The charging tower has built-in tool storage so no unsightly, disorganized tools laying around - just flip the door open it's all right there for you.  \n\nOne of the worst tasks of vacuuming is emptying the canister.  Vacuum manufacturers will put tons of effort into HEPA filtration, keeping microscopic particles  out of the air - yet once you have to empty the canister all those particles are back in the air.  LG has taken that task and once you add the CordZero to the charging tower it will automatically empty the canister into a sealed, replaceable bag which is also discretely placed in the charging tower.\n\nPerformance is really good.  Our house is mostly hardwood floors with area rugs and had no issues with battery life.  I can see where a house with carpet in most rooms might have some issues.  The vacuum has 3 power settings and on the lowest setting I found myself looking for additional spots to clean as I still had plenty of battery left.  One feature I liked is the beater bar runs at the same speed regardless of the suction level.  I did run it on the highest setting on one of the high traffic rubs and was encouraged (and really grossed out) by the amount of stuff it managed to pull out. \n\nIf I had to improve it...I wish there was a way to charge a backup battery.  It's probably not needed for my use, but I can see running out during a deep cleaning session.  Also I wish the bag that empties the canister was larger.  Because we have dogs I can see these filling quickly and that's an additional expense to get the replacement bags.It's a small price to pay to not have dust flying in your face whenever you have to empty the canister.</td>

      <td>My favorite vacuum!!!</td>
      <td>I have an addiction to vacuums.  With 2 cats and a recently passed dog, vacuums mean a lot to me.  \n\nThis vacuum was easy to put together but base took a few minutes to figure out-then I read the instructions and figured it out.  The base is tall and rather large but not ugly.   It is a perfect item to have out without looking tacky.  \n\nIt’s recharging when on the base, with the base being plugged in.  I love this because it really cleans itself.  Put the vacuum on the base and whoosh… and the cup is empty.  It’s a bit loud and takes longer than I think it should, but it is very good!  I have noticed that the more often it is cleaned the cleaner the plastic cup stays and the easier it is to see how full it is.  \n\nThe vacuum sucks!!!  Really well!  I am continually impressed at how well it does with the animal hair that manages to get ground in.  The vacuum is telescopic which made it very easy to get the stairs and the high corners of the ceiling.  \n\nI highly recommend this vacuum!  It works great, looks good, and would be an excellent gift.</td>

      <td>When it comes to vacuums, I’m kind of a vacuum aficionado, there’s something about vacuums that I find really intriguing, most vacuums, nowadays are powerful, sleek, and compact. The LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is no exception.\n\nThe newest thing about vacuums lately is that the higher end ones come with some kind of base where you could stick the vacuum in, and the base will suck out and empty out the garbage in your vacuum dust bin, while also charging the vacuums battery. I like the color white, gives it a classy look.\n\nThat is exactly what you’re getting here, once you’re done vacuuming, you just return the vacuum to its  base and it does the rest for you, pretty cool. Hands-free and you don’t have to deal with the dust that escapes if you try to empty out the vacuum yourself in the garbage can, read for people that have nasal allergies.\n\nI’m kind of disappointed that you only get one battery here, this vacuum would be perfect if it had 2. The good thing is It lasts long enough for you to clean your house or auto before you have to return it for charging. Just don’t expect it to run for hours on a single charge.\n\nAnd of course, it comes with different tools and attachments for cleaning different surfaces. I really like to use it to clean my car.\n\nOverall, it’s a really nice vacuum, it looks good, it’s made well, I’m really happy with it</td>

      <td>The Ultimate Cleaning Companion for a Pristine Home\n\nI recently had the pleasure of experiencing the LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle in Essence White, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. As someone who expects nothing but the highest quality, I can confidently say that this vacuum delivers on all fronts.\n\nAuto Empty - A Game-Changer for Cleanliness\n\nThe Auto Empty feature is revolutionary as it helps keep my home clean by automatically emptying the dustbin without scattering any debris. This process is initiated when I dock the vacuum in its All-in-One Tower, saving me the hassle of manually emptying the bin.\n\nKompressor Technology - Maximizing Bin Capacity\n\nWith the Kompressor lever, I can compress collected dirt, dust, and pet hair, increasing the bin's capacity by 2.4 times. This technology saves time and minimizes scattered dust when emptying the bin.\n\nDual Floor Max Nozzle - Versatile Cleaning Power\n\nThe Dual Floor Max Nozzle is a lifesaver, as it powerfully cleans my carpets and wood floors without needing attachment changes. Its built-in LED headlight reveals hidden debris, leaving no place for dirt to hide.\n\nThinQ App Wifi Enabled - Smart Maintenance\n\nI appreciate the convenience of monitoring vacuum maintenance and usage through the ThinQ app. It allows me to check the cleaning history and perform product diagnostics effortlessly.\n\nAll-in-One Tower Design - Elegant and Functional\n\nThe All-in-One Tower charges the battery and stores the vacuum and accessories discreetly. Its sleek design adds a touch of elegance to my home.\n\nOne-touch Control - Effortless Operation\n\nThe one-touch control system simplifies the vacuum's operation, reducing strain on my hand and ensuring a comfortable cleaning experience.\n\nTelescopic Wand - Flexible and Space-Saving\n\nThe adjustable telescopic wand provides flexibility during cleaning and conveniently stores away to save space.\n\nWashable Cyclone and Filters - Maintenance Made Easy\n\nMaintaining the vacuum is a breeze with removable and washable filters. LG CordZero's design allows you to remove the cyclone system and filters, ensuring your vacuum runs at its best.\n\nAdvanced Filtration Systems - Clean and Fresh Air\n\nThe 5-step filtration system on the vacuum effectively separates and filters dust, while the additional 3-step system in the All-in-One Tower ensures clean and fresh air in your home.\n\nDetachable Handheld Vacuum - Quick Spot Cleaning\n\nThe detachable handheld vacuum is handy, allowing quick and easy spot cleaning on various surfaces.\n\nSmart Inverter Motor - Powerful and Reliable\n\nThe Smart Inverter Motor delivers powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty, providing lasting peace of mind.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle is a masterpiece in cleaning technology. Its impeccable features, convenience, and exceptional performance make it the perfect companion for maintaining a pristine home. This vacuum meets and surpasses the highest standards, making it a worthwhile investment for those who demand nothing but the best.</td>

      <td>This CordZero is affirmation that there is a better way to do stick vacs. I had previously owned a stick vac but switched to a traditional corded one because there was a slew of issues with it from suction, battery and having to hold a “trigger” while operating it to not having a convenient way to store either the vac or accessories since I’m an apartment dweller and the thought of drilling into the wall doesn’t appeal to me (it’s more work when you move out). Enter LG and it seems like they really did their homework on this market. I was able to mostly get the vacuum and the other accessories together without having to refer to documentation - so I’d say it’s intuitive. There’s a dedicated on/off button and no need to hold anything during operation. The suction seems more powerful than my last stick vac (i.e. this one picks up shreddings from my paper shredder whereas my last one would blow them around or simply pass over them). And the charging base stores the vacuum, accessories and includes a dust bin that cleans out the vac. And I don’t miss having to stop when I’m vacuuming room to room to relocate a cable. The battery is fine for my average-sized apartment to knock out the whole place on a single charge. I didn’t mess with the power settings as the default was fine for me, but I imagine if you kicked up the settings more, the battery drain would be more pronounced. That said, it would be nice if there were a way to both store and charge extra batteries on the base. That’s my only suggestion - especially if someone were to move from say an apartment to a house where suddenly there’s more square footage (or a 1 bed to multi-room apartment even). The head has a very powerful motor in it as well and the vacuum is both louder and produces more vibration than I expected as well. Again, this is on the default setting so I know on a more powerful setting both of these two things would be more pronounced. It’s not as big of an issue for me, but living above someone else, I’m always trying to be conscious of noise in consideration of my neighbors. All in all, LG really created a winner and I can definitely see this being something great for a dorm, apartment, AirBNB, townhouse, etc. With the attachments, you could also use it clean out your car or furniture (i.e. sofa) as well.</td>

      <td>Your Last Vacuum</td>
      <td>I'm pretty smitten with this cordless vacuum cleaner. I really should not be this excited about an appliance but I love how they integrated a self-empting bin with this vacuum. The suction from this is really good and has rivaled all my previous vacuums including the ones from the brand that starts with a "D". You get about an hour of cleaning which is more than enough because I'm never going to vacuum for an hour. I will say the system takes up more room than a standard wand vacuum because of the self-empting dust bin. I do like how you can take the long nozzle off and use it in smaller places like your car with the provided attachments. The built-in headlight is very useful as well. The vacuum is very lightweight and manageable for even my children to use. One glaring negative is that I really don't want to have to buy replacement proprietary bin bags as that can get expensive. I realize that with convenience there is a cost and this is just one that I may just have to live with. This is truly an outstanding vacuum and can handle hardwood floors as well as carpets. Highly recommended.</td>

      <td>Super strong but the battery life disappoints</td>
      <td>Great suction, probably the best of any vacuum I’ve owned. The led light is way more helpful than I expected. I appreciate that the handle can lay almost completely flat, allowing it to reach further under furniture. Being able to compress the contents of the dust cup allows for fewer stops to empty the canister. \n\nThe vacuum is very lightweight, making it easy to maneuver. The height is adjustable as well, which makes it much easier on my back. \n\n  On the downside, the battery life was less than I expected. With a full charge I was able to clean about 800 square feel before the battery died.  It does have varying levels of suction power that undoubtedly impact the battery life differently, but the powerful suction is the best feature. It took roughly 3.5 hours to completely recharge the battery from 0. \n\n  The overall design of the docking station is sleek but does require more room than anticipated because of clearance required to open the sides to access attachments and replacement filters.</td>

      <td>To start off. The LG Cordzero  is an excellent vacuum with plenty of suction and light enough to tote around the house, up stairs or down. The dual brush power head is perfect for smooth floors and lower pile carpets. And while the tower to empty, store and charge the Cordzero is a nice feature to have if you have the space. This kit is currently missing a few things to be the true All in One kit to have. Luckily, LG does sell the rest of the kit separately if you feel you need it. Read on for a bit more real world use and opinion.\n\nVacuuming times will vary greatly. In my home I did kind of a rushed plan of attack like friends or family were on the way and I just need to tidy up a bit. I went across all floors and the vacuum rarely needed a second or third pass to appear clean. This is likely thanks to the smooth front roller and brushed rear roller in the powered vacuum head. And the light bar across the front made this easy to see on non-carpeted floors. All cleaning was done on the medium power setting (default when powering on vac). After 13+ minutes the vac ran out of power and turned off. It was enough to briskly clean most of the main floor. Then before putting vac back in tower. I pushed the lever down a couple times to remove fuzzy debris inside vac to make the self empty easier. After the  tower emptied the vac, I checked to see how clean it got. And all but a tiny stone was gone. So, pretty good for not having to empty dust cup myself. Time will tell how how often the tower vacuum bag will require changing.\n\nBattery life is a bit weak. In my testing I only managed about 13 minutes on the medium (default) suction mode with a 50/50 split of carpet and hardwood cleaning. That is very short in the normal 15-20 minutes many other cordless vacs provided in similar cleaning cycles. While not included in this kit, and the tower does not seem to be able to store or charge, additional batteries are available and larger homes may require more than 1 battery. \n\nThe tower is nice storage/charger base. However, it is huge and will require extra space many might skip over a simple charger brick. And while there is a lot of storage with the tower. And the tower does include its own vacuum, bag and filter set to keep up on. This kit does not include many of the items that would be stored inside. You do get a spare vacuum bag and filter, plus a crevice nozzle and 2 in 1 duster attachment. You will see many other attachments mentioned in the manuals that are not included, but may be important to your cleaning needs. An extra battery and the little brush to clean the interior of the dust cup seems to be the least of the kit that should have been included at the current price.\n\nOverall most will be happy with the Cordzero and tower combo. If dust bunnies and plenty of smooth floor adorns your house. This combo kit will easily keep you charged and the self emptying tower keeps the vac ready for the next vacuuming cleaning. The massive box this kit comes in will likely require muscle help for many to get this home, but once in house. The tower is literally remove from box and plug it in (and maybe secure to wall with included strap). The Cordzero effortlessly just slots in and starts the empty cycle and after a nice melody (LG washer/dryer owners will know this tune) it starts charging. While 4 hours to charge the vac seems excessive. It is doing this while you likely do not need to use the vac. And there is an app to know when the battery is charged again, but I did not find it too helpful beyond that. When the kit goes on sale or includes the extra attachments it will likely then be a Best Buy.</td>

      <td>The LG CordZero is a convenient vacuum with good suction for hard surface flooring and acceptable efficiency for low pile carpets. \nIf you have thick or shaggy carpet I would not recommend getting this vacuum. \n\nWhat makes this vacuum different is that it has a base station that charges and empties the vacuum. This is convenient to avoid having to constantly manually empty the canister.  The drawback is that the base is a bit large so you'll have to find a suitable area to place it. I chose my laundry room so it's out of sight. Another unique feature is that the vacuum is Wi-fi enabled to let you know when you need to replace the base stations filter and maintain your vacuum (through the LG ThinQ app). You may also track usage statistics, and access additional features.\nI did not particularly want to use the app, and it is not necessary for the vacuum to function fully, but if you like to monitor all your appliances, it's worth downloading.\n\nIt comes with the standard vacuum attachments so nothing impressive there, though you can get an additional bedding attachment sold separately (probably great to get dog hair off your bed).\n\nI do recommend it if you want to capitalize on its wifi features. There are some replaceable filters you'll have to purchase over time so keep that in mind.</td>

      <td>A great stick vacuum with awesome self-empty mode!</td>
      <td>Quick Overview\n=================================\nThis LG CordZero All-in-One is my second LG vacuum and I've been pleasantly surprised by their quality compared to premium ones like Dyson. This specific model has an "all in one" tower that automatically suctions out the vacuum's dust bin and puts it down into a separate bag for easy, mess-free disposal. Also, the inclusion of a Dual Floor head allows you to clean hard floors and carpets without changing heads.\n\n\n\n\nOverall build\n=================================\nCompared to the LG A9 from a big warehouse store, this model feel more premium with nice metal trim and an all-white finish. The All-in-One stand is very nice looking and allows for storage of different tips and nozzles to keep the area looking nice and neat. \n\nTo access the extra compartments and the suction bag (that empties your dust canister), you just open the left and right sides. \n\nAs expected, you can hang the vacuum into place and allow it to charge and empty the canister (automatically or manually - just push the buttons at the top).\n\nI really like the look of this compared to my old LG. Sure, it was fine an looked like a stick vacuum should look in the post-Dyson era, but this All-in-One stand hides all the clutter nicely.\n\nIt uses the same batteries as my other LG vacuum, which is nice, given the battery life. \n\nAnother standout feature, in my opinion, is the Kompressor (not to be confused with Mercedes-Benz's engine tech!) which allows you to slide a lever downward to compress all the hair and dust in the bin to make it more compact and easy to empty. I wish all vacuums had this! My Dyson (with a much larger canister) gets full of hair wrapped around the entire suction area and a "Kompressor" would really help with cleaning it out.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\n=================================\nThis vacuum is powerful and flexible! For those that suffer from any ailments that prevent them from holding a vacuum "trigger" for a long time, definitely look into the LG ones! With these, you just push a thumb button to turn the vacuum on or off. No need to hold down a button while vacuuming. \n\nSuction-wise it's plenty powerful, even lifting up a thin rug easily. We used the Dual Floor Max Nozzle on wooden floors, tile, thick carpet, and rugs with no problems. Based on the amount of dust, debris, and hair (3 girls with long hair!) picked up, it looks like a worthy competitor to our Dyson (though the Dyson has a larger canister).\n\nWhere the LG can pick up the slack is that it's super-easy to empty the canister to start cleaning again. Just dock it into the All-in-One base and it will automatically (or manually, if you prefer) suction out all the dust and put it into a bag that sits lower in the stand. It happens quickly and powerfully, and once you get used to having an easy-empty canister system like this, you'll never go back to dumping the canisters manually into the trash and having fine dust fly everywhere!\n\nAdditionally, having the Kompressor to push everything down off of the vacuum canister probably helps the suction system easily empty the canister. My large Dyson takes manual (and dirty!) reaching and pulling to get everything out of the canister. Sure, it's larger and holds more, but it's also a lot more work to clean.\n\nThe Dual Floor Max nozzle also has LEDs that help illuminate the path of the vacuum which is great under furniture or dark areas. Sure, it's not as cool as Dyson's green beam, but it's just as effective, if not more so.\n\nI'd say the only downside is the battery life is very short - it's a powerful vacuum, but it only lasts around 10-11 minutes. I have the good fortune of being able to swap these batteries out with my other LG, but if you don't have two LG vacuums with compatible batteries, that'd put a stop to your cleaning for awhile.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n=================================\nOverall, I'd say this is a great vacuum that's easy to use - especially for those that don't like holding down a "trigger" while vacuuming. Yes, the canister is small, but the ability to easily empty it makes up for it!\n\nI'd say the downsides include the short battery life and the fact that you'll have to pay for replacement bags (the ones that sit in the All-in-One stand to empty your vacuum canister) constantly. As expected, LG wants you to use new bags all the time, not dump and reuse old bags.\n\nAll in all, this is now the #1 vacuum in the house due to the ease of use, effective suction/cleaning nozzle, and easy emptying mechanism!</td>

      <td>A Versatile and Powerful Cleaning Solution</td>
      <td>----- SUMMARY -----\n\nVerdict:\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful, versatile, and easy-to-use vacuum cleaner. It has a sleek, modern design, and it comes with a variety of features that make it a great choice for both cleaning hard floors and carpets. The vacuum's powerful suction is impressive, and it does a great job of picking up dust, debris, and hair. The one-touch control makes it easy to operate, and the Auto Empty function is a convenient way to keep the dust bin clean. The battery life is also good, and the removable filters are easy to clean. Overall, the LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great choice for anyone looking for a high-quality vacuum cleaner.\n\nPros:\n  -  Elegant and versatile design\n  -  All-in-One Tower included for easy charging, storing, and auto-emptying\n  -  Dual Floor Max Nozzle adapts to different surfaces and has built-in LED headlight\n  -  Detachable hand vacuum and telescopic wand for cleaning hard-to-reach areas\n  -  One-touch control for effortless operation\n  -  Kompressor Technology to maximize debris collection\n  -  Smart Inverter Motor for powerful suction\n  -  10-year limited warranty for the motor\n  -  Cyclone system and removable filters for easy maintenance\n  -  ThinQ app for tracking cleaning history, diagnostics, and tips and tricks\n\nCons:\n  -  Battery life varies greatly depending on power mode and nozzle used\n\n----- DETAILS -----\n\nDesign:\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is a versatile and elegant cleaning device that offers great convenience. One unique feature is the All-in-One Tower, which allows for easy charging, storage, and auto-emptying of the vacuum. The Dual Floor Max Nozzle is adaptable to different surfaces, and it comes with a built-in LED headlight that illuminates hidden dust. Even in broad daylight, it was surprising to see a lot of dust and debris on my floors that were not visible to the naked eye. The LED headlight makes it easier to get completely clean floors, and it’s extra satisfying to see the dust and debris gone. Another design aspect I appreciate is the detachable hand vacuum and the telescopic wand, which let you clean hard-to-reach areas with ease. LG seems to have put a lot of thought into the design of the vacuum and the All-in-One Tower, as both devices have a sleek, modern design. I also appreciate the hidden storage for tools and accessories within the tower.\n\nOperation:\nThe LG CordZero vacuum cleaner is effortless to use thanks to its one-touch control feature. You can turn the vacuum on and off and adjust the power level with just your thumb. Once you're done vacuuming, you can dock the vacuum in the tower, and it will automatically empty the dustbin. This vacuum cleaner is designed to provide maximum debris collection by starting with an empty dustbin every time. Additionally, it comes with Kompressor Technology, which is a lever that compresses collected debris and hair in the bin. This technology allows you to create more bin capacity without increasing the size of the vacuum. This is a smart innovation that maximizes the vacuum's effectiveness. The Auto Empty and Kompressor Technology features are fantastic for someone like me who has kids and pets.\n\nPerformance:\nI have been really impressed with the performance of the LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum. It has a powerful suction thanks to its Smart Inverter Motor. Whether I vacuum my hardwood floor or carpet, I am amazed by how much dust, debris, and hair it can pick up. Considering its compact size, I did not expect it to work so well. I am pleasantly surprised, and using it is a joy as it ensures a clean floor every time. Additionally, the fact that its motor is supported by a 10-year limited warranty gives me peace of mind.\n\nBattery Life:\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum comes equipped with a quick-release battery that is powerful enough to clean my 2,000-square-foot home. The amount of time the vacuum can run varies depending on the power mode selected (Normal, Power, or Turbo), and whether the powered Dual Floor Max Nozzle is being used or just the stick and a non-powered tool. LG claims that the vacuum can run for up to 60 minutes on normal power mode, but that is only possible when using the stick mode with a non-powered tool. When using the Dual Floor Max Nozzle, I found that the vacuum ran for an average of about 45 minutes on Normal mode, 30 minutes on Power mode, and 10 minutes on Turbo mode. I usually prefer to use the Power mode to make sure that I have enough battery life for the area I'm cleaning. It's powerful enough for all my needs. Turbo mode is very powerful, but I only use it when I need to clean a small area. The battery is removable, so it's easy to replace it with a spare one (sold separately) for longer cleaning sessions.\n\nMaintenance:\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is a user-friendly and low-maintenance cleaning device. Its cyclone system and detachable filters can be easily cleaned, making them more durable and efficient. The vacuum also comes with the aforementioned Auto Empty feature that automatically disposes of the dust bin into a bigger bag, keeping your hands, floors, and air free from dust and debris. Additionally, both the vacuum and the tower are highly effective in preventing the spread of debris on the recently cleaned floor.\n\nThinQ App:\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is designed to work together with the ThinQ app seamlessly. I had no trouble pairing the vacuum with the app via Wi-Fi. With the help of the ThinQ app, you can easily keep track of the vacuum's cleaning history and run diagnostics. Additionally, the app offers maintenance tips and tricks to help you optimize the use of your vacuum. The ThinQ app has a straightforward and user-friendly interface that is available on both iOS and Android devices.\n\n----- WHAT’S IN THE BOX -----\n\n1 x A931KWM CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum\n1 x Telescoping Wand\n1 x Dual Floor Max Nozzle\n1 x Quick Release Battery\n1 x Combination Tool\n1 x Crevice Tool\n1 x Extra Pre-Filter\n2 x Tower Bags\n1 x Owner Manual for Vacuum\n1 x Owner Manual for All-in-One Tower</td>

      <td>Visually Stunning with Superior Performance</td>
      <td>Vacuums are a dime a dozen, but for those looking for the top of the line, LG has not disappointed with this model. From the aesthetics to the performance this vacuum exceeds all expectations.\n\nFirstly, right out of the box you can tell this is a premium product as it is not made entirely of just cheap plastic. It has a premium feel to it and the base is extremely sturdy where I did not have any issues with it being unsteady or falling over. Assembly was quick and easy as it comes nearly fully assembled so I was up in running in just five minutes. The look of the vacuum it is great, but the interior storage compartments for the accessories is an extremely useful feature so that they are not out in the open.\n\nMoving onto the performance though is where this vacuum really shines! This thing handled everything I threw at it as it picked up everything from our hardwood floors and longer thread carpet. The battery life was the most amazing feature as after nearly 50 minutes the battery was still going. I will say that it did take about 3 hours to recharge the battery, but it did not matter as the 50-60 minute battery life is all I need. The other great feature I have to mention is how light the vacuum is as it is a breeze to use and especially when you detach the stick of the vacuum to use it in handheld mode it is extremely light and portable compared to some others in this category that are more clunky. The extendable wand length was also extremely useful in handheld mode for those hard to reach places.\n\nThe first feature that sets this vacuum apart is the self-emptying dust-bin. This is such a convenient feature as it not only results in the dust you just sweep up being released back into the air, but it also helps in keeping the vacuum as light as possible for it alleviates any dust retained in the sweeper while using. The filters of the vacuum are great in that the pre-filter is washable that reduces the need to purchase filters on a constant basis. There`s also a "Kompressor" feature that compresses the dust in the bin to reduce the need to go put the vacuum back on the base during use. \n\nOverall, this vacuum has it all from its appearance to its performance. The self-emptying dust bin, washable filters, and "Kompressor" really set this vacuum apart. Along with the performance and how light the vacuum is it checks all the boxes completely! For these reasons I would strongly recommend this product to those looking for a high end vacuum with all the bells and whistles!</td>

      <td>Nice vacuum and wonderful improvements!</td>
      <td>The LG CordZero line keeps getting better and better. I really like the improvements they have made to this line. The battery power lasts a long time. I have about a 2300 SF house and I can get all of it vacuumed on one charge. The only issue I have is that we have a dog that sheds A LOT, so I do have to empty the cannister twice or three times. Honestly though, emptying the cannister takes no time or effort at all, especially with the collection tower. All I have to do is set up the vacuum on the tower and the rest is done. The tower contains a powerful suction that collects all of the dust into a vacuum bag. It's very convenient and clean compared to having to empty it by hand in a trash can. Another great feature is the lever on the side of the cannister. Now instead of trying to fish out hair that got wrapped around the filter at the top of the cannister, you can press the lever down and it will bring a ring down from the top of the cannister to push all the hair down to the bottom of the cannister making it easier to clean out. It makes things so much better. \nThe noise level of the vacuum is moderate. I mean, it's a vacuum so it's going to make noise. \nAssembly took no time at all. Overall I would highly recommend this vacuum.</td>

      <td>Game changing coming from a traditional vacuum!</td>
      <td>This is truly one of the nicest vaccuum cleaners I have ever seen or used! Having this in my home is an absolute luxury. Vacuuming with traditional vacuums can be quite the hassle considering their weight, usage restrictions because of their electrical cords, not being able to reach or fit into small places with then (ie. under couches), and clunky restrictive hoses that drag the whole vacuum with you when trying to reach into crevices - thankfully, none of these issues are a problem with the LG CordZero! \n\nThe CordZero is a light, sleek, cordless dream of a vacuum with extremely high maneuverability that can be held for long periods of time without getting tired, can be used anywhere with ease and no electrical outlet, and can fit in small hard-to-reach places (especially with its telescoping neck and its brush/crevice attachments!), it's truly incredible! It has an exchangeable battery with excellent battery life (I can easily vaccum my whole home on one charge), multiple (3) levels of vaccuum intensity, as well as easily cleanable and replaceable filters. The self-emptying charging base (which also stores the vacuum attachments) is also really fantastic; a very nice addition to an already amazing vaccuum! It empties the vacuum automatically when placed on the base to charge, which is a hugely convenient time-saver! The dirt from the vacuum gets deposited into a vacuum bag stored inside the base that can be easily replaced as well. \n\nIn terms of actually vacuuming, the main "traditional" vaccuum head is fantastic and cleans all surfaces very well, with a swiveling neck that translates a turn of the wrist to a turn of the vacuum head and has a visibility light on the front to help see dirt in dark, covered spaces you are cleaning! It is especially good at catching crumbs and dirt because of its rotating felt rod underneath the head, which is great for cleaning hardwood floors and carpet. In addition, the other two included head attachments are great for disrupting dirt and for reaching dirt in crevices or hard to reach places, essentially turning the vaccuum into a high powered dust-buster (or hose vacuum from traditional vaccuums, just much easier to use!). As a final note, there is also LG ThinQ app support for this vaccuum, where you can view your cleaning history and obtain vacuum maintenance information/diagnostics right from your phone via wifi connectivity to the vacuum!\n\nOverall, using this vacuum is so quick, easy and effective that it honestly discourages me from even using my Roomba! I highly recommend checking this vacuum out!</td>

      <td>I just picked up the new LG - CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle and so far, I think it’s neat. I love the look, the charging dock, the storage, the automatic bag empty, almost everything. The one drawback was the battery life at around 10-12 minutes! I listed the pros and cons below.\n\n \n\nPros:\n\n1. Innovative Storage and Charging: The LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum truly stands out with its convenient storage and charging station. The fact that it neatly stores away in the charger is a huge plus, ensuring that the vacuum is always charged and ready to go. This feature adds to the overall convenience and ease of use.\n\n \n\n2. Efficient Dirt Collection: The inclusion of a bag within the charging station for dirt collection is a smart design choice. It simplifies the process of emptying the vacuum and keeps the area tidy, which is particularly beneficial for those who prioritize cleanliness and hassle-free maintenance.\n\n \n\n3. Versatile Attachments: This version of the vacuum comes equipped with three different head attachments, enhancing its versatility. This allows for a more customized cleaning experience, catering to various surfaces and cleaning needs.\n\n \n\n4. Adjustable Size: The ability to extend and shorten the vacuum is a significant advantage. It transforms from a full-sized stick vacuum to a compact handheld device, making it suitable for a variety of cleaning tasks, from floor to ceiling.\n\n \n\n5. Powerful Suction: The suction power of this vacuum is impressive. It's so strong that there's often a need to reduce it, highlighting its efficiency in picking up dirt and debris. This level of suction power is a testament to the vacuum's performance capabilities.\n\n \n\nCons:\n\n1. Short Battery Life: The most notable downside is the battery life. The vacuum lasts for about 10-12 minutes on a full charge, which is relatively short. This limitation can be a significant drawback for those needing longer cleaning sessions. It's more suitable for quick cleanups rather than extensive vacuuming tasks. It is advertised to have a runtime of 60 minutes, I don’t want to try and be efficient with the power when vacuuming, I want ALL THE POWER when cleaning. Sheesh.\n\n \n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThe LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum is an excellent choice for quick and efficient cleanups. Its design is thoughtful, with features like a combined storage and charging station, versatile attachments, and adjustable size. However, the short battery life can be a limiting factor for some users. It's ideal for small, quick cleaning tasks like kitchen spills or stair cleaning, but may not be the best option for more prolonged cleaning sessions.</td>

      <td>The LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle presents an imposing statement that, because of its size, seems at first to be a bit overdramatic for a stick vacuum. But wait for the reveal of features and functions that the LG brings to this category of appliances. What our first days of using the LG Cod Zero reveals is a VERY powerful vac, with vacuuming capacity and strength that is better than every previous stick vac we’ve owned. It adds an auto-emptying feature that works effectively and conveniently. Not having to swap out attachments for our wood, tile and carpeted floors is another convenience.\n\nSETUP: The storage unit required removing some packaging tape strips, standing it upright, and plugging it in. This is a free-standing unit. The vacuum was a bit more puzzling, but with only a floor nozzle, extension pipe, vac body and battery to work with, that final assembly takes only a few minutes. Placing the assembled vac in the storage station starts the charging which requires up to 3.5 hours when fully discharged. A few musical notes let you know it’s seated properly. This same station has controls on top for initiating an emptying cycle. Behind the doors on either side of the charging station are spots for storing tools. A crevice and combination tool are provided.  None of this requires much effort or the instructions to figure out, for that matter. \n\nPERFORMANCE: This is serious vacuum, competitive with the best vacs you can buy, no matter whether they are stick or full sized canister vacs.  This LG uses a new design floor nozzle which has a soft roller for trapping dust and an agitator to stir dust up into the suction. It really works well. We love having a powerful array of LED lights to illuminate under furniture and help hair and dust stand out for removal. The wand is adjustable so whether my wife or I are vacuuming, we can stand comfortably or reach for a high location with the accessory tools. Changing the LG into a handheld vacuum is a simple process of swapping out the adjustable long wand and replacing it with either the crevice tool or the combination tool. We’ve done this before.\n\nLG has a unique sliding compression feature on the dust bin that creates space for a longer vacuuming session. This also works well. We inspected the bin after vacuuming our rugs and there were no indications that carpet fibers were being extracted out of the carpet. There was debris, dirt, dust and some food crumbs. I couldn’t deny that snacks were on the move around the house. \n\nLG’s vacuum engine utilizes a series of filters and separating devices to ensure dust stays in the bin and does not re-enter the room. LG uses a washable pre-filter and provides an extra so you can take one out of service while it dries thoroughly. Even the potentially messy job of emptying the vacuum bin is taken out of the our hands. The storage/charging station can be set to manually or automatically empty the bin when the vacuum is placed back into it. All debris is deposited into a disposable bag. \n\nI measured vacuum noise level and found that it reached 80dB for the lower speed and 82dB at the higher vacuum speed, both measured with my iPhone sound app at one meter away. There is a turbo mode (touch “+” twice), also. Peak levels were a bit louder. This is somewhat noisier than other premium vacs we’ve used recently. However, the vacuuming power is exceptional, so we were not surprised. \n\nConnecting to LG’s ThinQ app tracks cleaning history and can run diagnostics. We’ve connected this app to several LG devices and it simplifies some tasks and also provides support.\n\nSUMMARY: The LG is a well designed vacuum that is comfortable in the hand, maneuvers along any type floors with ease despite a solid build, can get fairly low under most of our furniture, and leaves no dirt behind. Operational time never came up shorter than our vacuuming session which often exceeded 40 up to 50 minutes with energy to spare. The auto-empty feature works flawlessly and helps make this necessary chore easier to accomplish. We’re only managing a dust bag at very long intervals, and we never contact collected dirt. This is a premium vacuum that justifies a premium price.</td>

      <td>LG Ups The Ante But falls Short On Battery Life</td>
      <td>Upon unpacking the new LG Cordzero stick vacuum I was impressed how well it was packed which has usually been my experience for higher end items.  This vacuum was extremely easy to set up and literally took me no more than 10 minutes.\nAfter letting the battery charge overnight and showing fully charged, I gave it a go.  The unit has an easy adjustable wand to match your comfortability in pushing back and forth.  After I adjusted I began vacuuming.  The first thing I noticed right off the bat was how light it was and free moving.  It glided easily across my laminate flooring grabbing everything in its path.  For areas of heavier debris, I pressed the + button on the handle to increase the air flow and motor speed.  Seemed to work flawlessly.  Next I wanted to test in on carpet with low to medium shag as well as a few dining room and living room rugs.  Seemed to work fine and did the job, but I felt a higher powered vacuum would do a deeper cleaning job if needed and have heavier shedding pets.  One thing that I really like is the LED lights on the dual head nozzle that show all the small crumbs you might have missed.  Great throughout the house and hard to see areas.  After about 10 minutes the battery went dead.  Please note that 10+ minutes was a guestimation.  I put the stick on it's charger and the cycle and suction began draining the vacuum of all the dust and debris which I feel is an absolutely cool feature.  After about a minute in began charging.  The LG ThinQ app is a great way to check on the charging while your away and can assist if maintenance is needed.  This is a really cool app if you own a lot of LG products.  \nThis is a sleek looking unit with attachment storage inside each panel door on the left and the right, which is nice compared to other stick vacuums out there where you have to put attachments in separate locations.  Note: this particular model only comes with one battery and no other area to charge a second battery like the other model that LG carries.\nSpeaking of battery life, I was curious if I had done something wrong earlier to get such a low amount of battery life the first time, so I waited over half a day, checked the app and unit showing fully charged and put it to the test a second time.  This time using a timer.\nThe battery lasted 11 minutes 58 seconds on the nose.  The battery life promised on this vacuum is up to 60 minutes.  I would say I am pretty disappointed with how long it actually lasted.  This is pretty common with past stick vacuums I have owned in the past.  Maybe I received a faulty battery or maybe the manufacturer should automatically sell each unit with two batteries.  \nOverl all, I give the LG CordZero 4 stars only losing one start for it's battery life.  This is still a beautiful unit and with all it's cool features well worth the investment.</td>

      <td>The LG CordZero will be a trusty tool in anyone’s home or business.  It’s sturdy, reliable, powerful, and user friendly. Anyone who picks up this LG will pretty much know how to use it. \n\nThe base or tower automatically charges and cleans out your stick vac every time you set it in vac’s cradle.  The top of the base is touch sensitive with buttons that allow you to turn off the auto clean function or manually start a clean cycle. In my opinion, the base is very large however this is because the base allows you to store all your components and attachments on each side under closed doors.  Many other high end stick vacs don’t offer this closed up storage.  The two side doors each have a small square door within the larger door that rotate out which allows the large attachment stick and floor brush to be placed while using the smaller attachments.  This is a big pro as you don’t have to lean your brush head and tube on a wall.  \n\nThe auto empty feature is honestly great.  Pretty much you just set your vac in the tower’s cradle after using the vac for a small or large job and the tower will take it from there.  Including emptying your lg vac and charging the battery. The only thing is that the tower requires bags unlike the vac which is bag less.  I’m sure this is based on design and efficiency as almost all other brands also do this.  However, I wish the tower was bag less as it will make life that much easier than making sure you order the correct replacement bag and in time for when you need them. \n\nThe LG CordZero vac is pretty cool and is designed tastefully.  I don’t mind using it almost every day.  It’s powerful with LGs kompressor technology which makes me think of that Mercedes model!  I appreciate that the vac is equipped with buttons to decrease and increase suction with so many levels.  You can fine tune how much suction you need depending on the task. I specifically find this useful for when you’re vacuuming carpet, car floor mats or pillows with attachments.  You can make sure you have enough suction to suck but also not to much to suck up the whole pillow.  I appreciate that the battery is removable and it’s easy to remove with your fingers and a screw driver is not required.  If you use your vac hard or for cleaning cars or a business you often need more juice!  This allows someone to easily swap out batteries or when it’s time for a replacement just simply pop out the battery and throw in a new one.\n\nThe attachments include a crevice tool, combination tool, a telescoping wand, and large dual floor nozzle or head.  I noticed right away that the wand is made of high quality metal and materials and it seems like it has some type of powder coating material on it.  I also noticed that in order to dock the vac with the wand and large head the wand has to be on its shortest setting. So when I use the vac I have to extend the wand each time to use it (I am 5 9) and before docking the vac I have to fully shorten the wand for it to doc correctly. Adds an extra step and I am not sure why the tower/base is not taller to accommodate this I mean it’s already large. A big pro is that the dual floor brush is equipped with a full set of LEDs.  Sometimes I vac with the lights off now just because the LG illuminates the floor and I can track and suck up all the dirt and hair.   More specifically, the lights work amazing on hard surfaces. \n\nMy only real disappointment is that this was not equipped with a smaller motorized brush head.  I find this to be a needed and useful tool for everyday tasks like vacuuming car floor mats and upholstered furniture. I believe you can purchase this additional attachment separately and the next model up also includes it.  However it still should be included.</td>

      <td>LG CordZero Review: Efficient & User-Friendly</td>
      <td>The LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum, featuring a Dual Floor Max Nozzle, arrives in a premium package. The box includes:\n&gt; LG CordZero Vacuum\n&gt; Auto-Empty Base Station Tower\n&gt; Telescopic Wand\n&gt; Dual Floor Max Nozzle\n&gt; Removable Quick Release Battery (chargeable via tower)\n&gt; Combination Tool\n&gt; Crevice Tool\n&gt; Extra Pre-Filter\n&gt; 2 Tower Bags\n&gt; Owner’s Manual\n\nKey features include Auto Empty, Kompressor Technology, Dual Floor Max Nozzle, Washable Cyclone and Filters, and a Smart Inverter Motor.\n\n[Design and Build Quality]\nThe CordZero's thoughtful design is evident. The tower efficiently stows tools and automates debris disposal. The built-in LEDs in the Dual Floor Max Nozzle illuminate debris, facilitating cleaning. Although predominantly plastic, it has a high-quality feel and is heavier than expected.\n\n[Setup and Ease of Use]\nSetup is straightforward, involving quick assembly and organizing tools in the tower. The user interface simplifies operation, offering easy on/off toggling and power level adjustment. A slide lever for debris removal alongside the internal cylinder is a particularly nice maintenance feature.\n\n[Performance]\n&gt; Suction Power: Offers three levels; the middle setting suffices for daily use.\n&gt; Battery Life: Adequate for a 2100 sq ft house, with about 30-35 minutes of runtime. Charging from empty takes under 3 hours.\n&gt; Maneuverability: The Dual Floor Max Nozzle aids in easy navigation, though the vacuum feels heavier with additional attachments.\n&gt; Noise Level: Comparable to other vacuums, both during operation and auto-emptying at the tower.\n\n[Maintenance]\nThe auto-empty feature significantly reduces maintenance. The tower bag fills about halfway in 3-4 days, indicating a weekly or bi-weekly emptying schedule. Washable filters and a dual brush head design in the nozzle reduce maintenance hassle.\n\n[Additional Features]\nIncludes the LG ThinQ app for usage history and diagnostics – a bonus for tech-savvy users.\n\n[Pros]\n&gt; Efficient auto-emptying feature.\n&gt; Compact tower that neatly stores all tools.\n&gt; 10-year limited motor warranty.\n&gt; Washable filters.\n\n[Cons]\n&gt; Battery life is shorter compared to some other high-end models.\n&gt; Squeaky wheels on the Dual Floor Max Nozzle on hardwood floors during turns.\n\n[Conclusion]\nCompetitively priced, offering good value considering the features and compared to other high-end vacuums.Highly recommended for those seeking a functional, maintainable, and user-friendly cordless vacuum. Particularly worth considering if found on sale.</td>

      <td>Premium all-in-one stick vacuum</td>
      <td>This premium cordless stick vacuum, the LG CordZero All-in-One Cordless Stick Vacuum with Dual Floor Max Nozzle, has been my reliable choice since 2022, and I continue to use it daily without any issues. While I own the higher-spec version, I find this budget-friendly model equally impressive, although it lacks certain features like a mopping head option and a liftable top lid for additional battery storage that is a charging station as well. It is equipped with a single battery, and during my testing, I observed that a fully charged battery provides a runtime of 10-11 minutes.\nBoth models share the same sleek all-in-one tower design, effectively organizing and storing all attachments. The vacuum maintains its high-quality build, powerful suction, and excellent maneuverability. A noteworthy enhancement is the addition of a headlight, providing a comprehensive vacuuming solution. The Dual Floor Max Nozzle efficiently cleans both carpets and hard floors without the need for attachment changes, showcasing remarkable suction power which I can teel after each vacuuming.  \nSeveral practical features contribute to the overall convenience of this vacuum. The LED headlight improves visibility, particularly under furniture, and a telescopic wand adds versatility. The tower itself is thoughtfully designed with controls for automatic emptying and hidden storage for tools behind its doors. The setup is intuitive and requires minimal effort.\nLG's sliding compression mechanism on the dustbin is a notable feature, creating extra space for extended vacuuming sessions. The vacuum's filters and separating devices effectively trap dust in the bin, preventing its re-entry into the room. Maintenance is simplified with a washable pre-filter, supplemented by an extra one. The automatic emptying function expedites the process, of depositing debris into a disposable bag.\nDespite the potentially space-consuming footprint of the tower, I find it justified by the comprehensive features it offers. It is convenient to store all attachments, charge the vacuum, and add a gorgeous overall appeal. This CordZero vacuum is Wi-Fi-enabled and can be added to the LG ThinQ app. This remote convenient access allows me to monitor the battery status as well as provides tips on how to clean the filter and run smart diagnosis for the entire vacuum. It comes with a combination tool, crevice tool, extra pre-filter, and 2 tower bags.</td>

      <td>Just This Side of Perfection</td>
      <td>This is the third “high end” cordless stick vacuum that has come into our household, and might just be the best one yet. The LG CordZero A931 All-In-One Tower Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty appears just about smack dab in the middle of the models in the CordZero line-up listed on the manufacturer’s web site.\n\nThe CordZero A931 vacuum comes with a powered, “Dual Floor Max”nozzle that is called out on the packaging and LG’s web site as being “New”. This model appears to be the first and as of now, only model that comes with the Dual Floor Max nozzle. Nozzles are motorized and tools are not in LG’s nomenclature. This nozzle is designed to clean both hard-surface flooring and carpet or rugs without having to make any adjustments to the nozzle when you move from one surface type to another. It also appears to be LG’s first CordZero nozzle with lights on it, 12 separate LEDs across the leading edge of the nozzle, and this feature alone is a BIG game changer when vacuuming hard-surface flooring.  Having a light down low, sweeping across the floor makes all of the debris on your floor just jump out at you and makes it so much easier to tell if you have vacuumed the whole area or have missed spots. Previous to having this vacuum I had to turn on every light in the room to see well enough to make sure I was thorough in my cleaning. Having a lighted nozzle makes it easier to clean in a very low-light environment because of the angle from which the light is illuminating the floor. The Dual Floor Max nozzle has two large, soft-rubber wheels at the back of the nozzle so that it rolls across hard floors creating a minimum of additional noise (some vinyl plank floors are quite rough and slightly bumpy) and also rolls easily across carpet. Depending on the nap length of your carpet, you will possibly want to select the lower power mode to make pushing the vacuum easier across carpet as the two most powerful modes suck the nozzle down onto the carpet quite strongly.\n\nThe motor unit has a comfortable hand grip with three pushbuttons that can be easily operated by your thumb when you are gripping the vacuum. There is a power on/off button so you don’t have to keep a trigger pulled for the motor to run like some competitor’s vacuums, and there are “+” and “-“ buttons to adjust the “suck”. The default power level when you turn on the vacuum is always the middle one, referred to as “Power”. The lower level is called “Normal”, and the strongest level is “Turbo”. One of these buttons is also used to connect the vac to wi-fi so you can utilize the  LG ThinQ app on your phone. This app has a number of features, but the one I found most useful is a notification sent to your phone when the vacuum is done recharging. There is a small display on the handle that gives you a readout for remaining battery strength consisting of three small lighted bars inside a battery-shaped icon. I didn’t find this as useful as the “time-remaining" or the numeric “percent-of-charge” information on the other vacuums we have.  The display will also use a lighted icon to alert you to a clog somewhere in the system somewhere and when it is time to wash the filters.  LG includes substantial and comprehensive printed documentation rather than forcing you to a web site for additional information not included in a quick start guide. I wish all manufacturers did the same.\n\nThe A931 comes with a single battery (although some models in the CordZero line-up come with two) that is removable from the motor unit and it gave me a run time of 48 minutes and 26 seconds with the vacuum on “Normal” (the lowest of three power settings) and no load on the Dual Floor Max nozzle (meaning it was spinning freely in the air). LG claims up to 60 minutes of run time on the “Normal” power mode with no powered nozzle attached, such as when using a non-powered tool, so I think this is a fair claim with a new battery. Using a motorized nozzle will decrease run time of the vacuum. After running the battery down until the vacuum stopped, the charger took 2 hours and 43 minutes to fully charge the battery. This is much quicker than the 3.5 to 4 hours stated in the manual or on the web site. LG lists batteries as a consumable item, so it is nice to have a removable one for when it ultimately fails - especially since the motor has a 10-year warranty, meaning they expect these vacuums to be around for a long while.\n\nIncluded with the A931 are a “Combination Tool” that is short with a medium-width opening and has a soft-bristle brush that slides back and forth on the tool if needed or not, and a short, stiff-plastic “Crevice Tool” with a narrow opening. LG offers an additional “Total Care Kit” that contains four more tools and a flexible hose. The maintenance section of the owners manual talks of using a cleaning brush (supplied with some models) in a variety of ways when cleaning the vacuum, but the A931 does not come with this brush. This appears to be intentional in order to save money on a brush that probably costs less than 50 cents to make, and really should be included with every model in the line in my opinion.\n\nThe All-In-One Tower with Auto Empty is the other fabulous feature of this CordZero model. Besides the docking location for the motor head to be charged, the tower also contains a disposable vacuum bag inside of it and when you dock the vacuum, the tower opens the door on the bottom of the dust bin, then collected debris is removed from the dust bin and sucked into the bag in the tower. And when it is done, the door on the dust bin is automatically closed for you! As someone who has used another brand of cordless stick vac with a charging stand that collects debris from the vacuum, and has removed the vacuum from the stand and started using it with the dust bin’s door still open, this is another BIG advantage in my mind. The dust bin on the vacuum has a manually operated slider referred to as the “Kompressor” which you use to remove debris from the cyclonic mesh filter and it then compresses it at the bottom of the dust bin for longer run times between emptying and to aid in the dust bin being thoroughly emptied by the tower. Another clever feature that works very well. The tower also has hidden tool storage for three tools behind the doors on either side of the tower, and has two swing out storage hooks on the exterior for nozzles, thus keeping it looking sleek and clean. Because of how the doors open, the tower fits best angled into a corner in a room so that the doors have room to swing open. When the vac is stored on the tower to charge, the footprint of the whole unit is 10 1/2” x 17 1/2” and the electrical cord is a generous 6 feet long. I was disappointed to learn that there are two models of the All-In-One Tower, as the one that comes with two-battery units has a storage compartment to house and charge the second battery. The tower that comes with the A931 does not accommodate a second battery if you were to buy one separately.\n\nThis CordZero model comes with a disposable dust bag installed in the tower and one additional bag, and an additional motor pre-filter. This pre-filter, the exhaust filter, and the cyclonic mesh filter are all washable with water and this maintenance is similar to other stick vacs I have used. The All-In-One tower also has a motor-protection filter and an exhaust filter that need periodic cleaning with water. The Dual Floor Max nozzle is easy to disassemble without tools or even a coin to twist open the cap of the powerhead. To remove the rotating brush and roller for cleaning, the end cap has a simple pushbutton to unlock and lock it into place.\n\nThe LG A931 All-In-One Tower Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty is a stylish appliance that can be placed in a home where others might see it and it doesn’t have to be stuck away in a closet. This makes it ideal for apartments or condos that may not have sufficient hidden storage or is lacking an electrical outlet to plug it into (none of the closets in our recently built house have electrical outlets). Modern vacuums have come a long way since what your mother had when you were a child and technology has made cords a thing of the past allowing these appliances to have the same or better cleaning performance as some of the best corded vacuums. The A931 is also light enough to make carrying it around the house an easy task and its design features very agile maneuverability making at least one household chore less of a chore. I am searching for the perfect vacuum (can you tell that floors are my job at home?) and this CordZero is oh so close. A tool that is well designed makes the use of it almost pleasurable, and I find the A931 a pleasure to use.</td>

      <td>I have been using a 7 year old shark stick to vacuum. I had no idea how much hair and dust were in my rugs till I used this. \nI have all had surface floors, but I have area rugs in the rooms. \nSetting up the vacuum will only take about 15 minutes. You should download the app. I don’t think you have to but it comes in handy. The stick is short, but there is a lever on the back to make it longer. It’s not super quiet during usage, but my dog didn’t run from the room. The first room i used this in was a bedroom area rug. I had turned the suction to high, but it pulled the rug up. So I had to turn the suction down. This did not try to suck up random power cords for cellphones like other vacuum. I didn’t see any pet hair accumulation on the brushes at the end. I did see an almost full dirt trap. \nWhen you plug the vacuum in to the charger/holder. There is already a trash bag in the machine, they send you an extra. You do have to shrink the handle back down for it to fit in the holder. When you put it in the holder you can hear the holder cleaning out the trash bin on the vacuum. If you have the app, you will get a notification when the vacuum is charged.\nMy only complaint, there is no power to the wheels of the vacuum. So it’s all arm strength to push it back and forth. I can see that would be an issue if you have taller pile carpeting</td>

      <td>Almost Perfect</td>
      <td>I struggled giving this 4 instead of 5 stars because in many ways this is a really useful and versatile product. \n\nSo lets get the stuff where this falls short out of the way. For this price I think it should come with more attachments. Mainly, something that gets way under furniture and appliances that are too close to the floor for the power head to reach. Also for this price I think it should come with the pet head. There is storage space for it should you decide to upgrade at least. However speaking of storage space, I could not find anywhere to store extra bags in the tower and there is no spot to charge an extra battery should you decide to purchase one separately. \n\nOn the other hand this is exceptional in every way other than that which I mentioned above. Out of the box it was easy to assemble and get ready for first charge and use. The vacuum its self fits well in the hand and is balanced nicely. The extendable main pipe is a great touch allowing you to make it more compact for storage and adjust the length for your stature when in use. \n\nThe power head both illuminates the cleaning area well and works great on carpets and hard floors. Overall, the form factor is easy on the eyes and makes for easy access when the time comes for cleanup. It has a lever that compacts the waste in the tank so you don't need to empty as often and also seems to make the emptying process more complete. \n\nSpeaking of emptying I really love that there is no more standing over a waste basket hoping that all the grime you just collected ends up where intended. Just put the unit in the base and it empties automatically into the bag in the lower part of the tower. Although, I think it should come with an additional head there are convenient hooks on either side of the tower to store the large head when you are using an attachment or another optional head. \n\nAll in all this is an elegant vacuum with great suction and is easy to use.</td>
